Breast cancer is a malignant tumor arising from abnormal cells in the breast ducts or lobules that grow uncontrollably and may invade nearby tissue or metastasize to lymph nodes and distant organs. Early-stage in-situ cancers are confined to ducts or lobules and are not life-threatening, while invasive cancers can form palpable lumps or thickening and spread to the axillary nodes, lungs, liver, bones or brain. Symptoms may include a breast lump, skin dimpling, nipple retraction, abnormal nipple discharge or changes in breast shape; many early cancers cause no symptoms. Risk factors include female sex, increasing age, inherited mutations such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, family history, prior chest radiation, obesity, alcohol use, reproductive factors and hormone therapy. Diagnosis requires imaging (mammography, ultrasound, MRI) and confirmation by biopsy with tumor receptor testing (ER, PR, HER2). Treatment depends on stage and subtype and may involve surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection, radiotherapy and systemic therapy. Endocrine therapy is effective for hormone-receptor-positive cancers, chemotherapy is used for many hormone-receptor-negative tumors, and HER2-positive cancers respond to targeted agents such as trastuzumab. Early, complete, multidisciplinary treatment improves survival and reduces recurrence.
