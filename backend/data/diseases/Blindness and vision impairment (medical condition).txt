Vision impairment occurs when an eye condition disrupts normal visual function, affecting clarity, field of vision, or the ability to detect contrast, colour or movement. Common causes include uncorrected refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia), cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal opacities, and congenital or developmental eye diseases in children. Symptoms may include blurred or distorted vision, difficulty reading or seeing at distance, glare sensitivity, reduced night vision, visual field loss or eye discomfort. Some conditions—such as dry eye, conjunctivitis or blepharitis—do not typically cause vision loss but can still be painful and disruptive. Risk factors vary by condition and may include ageing, diabetes, hypertension, prolonged screen use, UV exposure, eye trauma, infections, poor nutrition, prematurity, and hereditary disorders. Diagnosis involves comprehensive eye examination, including visual acuity testing, refraction, intraocular pressure measurement, slit-lamp examination and retinal evaluation. Many causes are preventable or treatable with interventions such as eyeglasses or contact lenses for refractive errors, cataract surgery, glaucoma medications, retinal laser or injections for diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration, and antimicrobial or lubricating therapy for ocular surface disease. Early detection is essential to prevent irreversible damage, and vision rehabilitation services help individuals with permanent vision loss maximize functional ability.
