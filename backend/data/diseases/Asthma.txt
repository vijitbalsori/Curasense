Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by reversible airway narrowing caused by inflammation and tightening of the airway muscles. Symptoms include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness, which may worsen at night, with exercise or in response to triggers such as viral infections, dust, smoke, pollen, animal dander, cold air or strong odors. Some individuals experience sudden worsening known as asthma attacks, which can be severe and require urgent care. Risk factors include a family history of asthma, coexisting allergic conditions such as eczema or allergic rhinitis, early-life respiratory infections, low birth weight, exposure to tobacco smoke or air pollution and obesity. Diagnosis is based on characteristic symptoms and lung function tests demonstrating variable airflow obstruction. Although asthma cannot be cured, it can be effectively controlled with inhaled medications. Bronchodilators provide rapid relief by opening the airways, while inhaled corticosteroids reduce inflammation and prevent attacks; many patients require daily controller therapy. Spacer devices can improve inhaler delivery, especially for children. Proper self-management involves recognizing triggers, monitoring symptoms, and adjusting treatment according to an asthma action plan. Severe or poorly controlled asthma may lead to sleep disturbance, daytime fatigue and increased risk of emergency episodes or hospitalization, but with appropriate therapy most individuals can lead normal, active lives.
