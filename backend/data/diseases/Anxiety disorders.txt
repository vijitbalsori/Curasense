Anxiety disorders are mental health conditions characterized by excessive, persistent fear or worry that is difficult to control and causes significant distress or impairment in daily functioning. Symptoms typically include restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, trembling, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, sleep disturbances and difficulty concentrating. Different forms include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder; individuals may have more than one type. Symptoms often begin in childhood or adolescence and may persist into adulthood. Anxiety disorders arise from a combination of biological vulnerability, genetic factors, psychological processes and adverse life experiences such as trauma or chronic stress. They commonly co-occur with depression and substance use disorders, and may worsen physical health conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease. Effective treatments include psychological therapies—especially cognitive-behavioural therapy and exposure-based approaches—which help individuals modify unhelpful thoughts, regulate emotions and gradually face feared situations. Stress-management techniques such as relaxation and mindfulness can reduce symptoms. Pharmacological treatment with antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, may be useful; benzodiazepines are generally avoided due to dependence risk. Early recognition, support and appropriate treatment improve long-term outcomes.
