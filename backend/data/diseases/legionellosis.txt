Legionellosis is an infection caused by Legionella bacteria, most commonly L. pneumophila, acquired through inhalation of contaminated aerosols from water systems or, less commonly, from potting mixes. It ranges from a mild, self-limited flu-like illness (Pontiac fever) to Legionnaires’ disease, a severe pneumonia with high morbidity and mortality. The bacteria thrive in warm water (20–50°C), biofilms and poorly maintained artificial water systems such as cooling towers, hot water systems, humidifiers and spas. Human-to-human transmission has not been documented. Legionnaires’ disease typically presents after a 2–10 day incubation period with fever, malaise, headache, loss of appetite, cough (sometimes productive or blood-streaked), diarrhea or confusion, and can rapidly progress to respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ failure. Risk is highest in people over 50, males, smokers, heavy drinkers, those with chronic lung, renal disease or immunosuppression, and hospitalized patients with recent surgery or ventilation. Diagnosis requires clinical suspicion and is confirmed by laboratory testing, including urinary antigen testing, culture or PCR. Pontiac fever resolves without treatment, but Legionnaires’ disease requires prompt antibiotic therapy, with outcomes depending on host factors and timeliness of treatment. Mortality ranges from 5–10% overall but can reach 40–80% in untreated immunocompromised patients. Prevention relies on water safety management, including regular cleaning, disinfection and temperature/chemical control of water systems to limit bacterial growth and aerosolization, especially in healthcare facilities.
