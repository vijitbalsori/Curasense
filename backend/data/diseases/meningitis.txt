Meningitis is an acute inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord and is a medical emergency due to its high risk of death and long-term disability. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, but bacterial meningitis is the most severe. The major bacterial causes are Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B strep). Transmission occurs mainly through respiratory droplets, except GBS, which passes from mother to baby at birth. Symptoms include fever, neck stiffness, headache, altered mental status, photophobia, vomiting, and sometimes seizures or a non-blanching rash (especially with meningococcal sepsis). Infants may present with poor feeding, irritability, bulging fontanelle, and convulsions. Diagnosis requires urgent lumbar puncture with CSF testing, but antibiotics must not be delayed when bacterial meningitis is suspected; corticosteroids may reduce complications. Vaccines against Hib, pneumococcus, and meningococcus provide the best prevention. Close contacts of meningococcal cases need antibiotic prophylaxis. Survivors may suffer permanent effects such as hearing loss, seizures, limb weakness or cognitive impairment. The highest disease burden occurs in sub-Saharan Africa’s meningitis belt, where epidemics are common. WHO’s “Defeating Meningitis by 2030” roadmap aims to reduce cases and deaths through vaccination, rapid diagnosis, treatment and strong surveillance.
