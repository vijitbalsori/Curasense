Colorectal cancer is a malignant tumour arising in the colon or rectum, usually affecting adults over 50 years. Early disease is often asymptomatic; later symptoms include altered bowel habits, blood in stool, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, fatigue and iron-deficiency anaemia. Major risk factors include older age, family history, hereditary syndromes (e.g., Lynch syndrome), inflammatory bowel disease, diets high in processed/red meat, obesity, smoking and alcohol use. Diagnosis relies on colonoscopy with biopsy, supported by imaging (CT/MRI) for staging and stool tests such as FOBT for screening. Screening is essential for early detection and removal of precancerous polyps and significantly reduces mortality. Treatment depends on stage: early-stage disease is managed with surgical resection often followed by adjuvant chemotherapy; rectal cancers may require neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Advanced or metastatic disease is treated with systemic therapy including chemotherapy, targeted agents (e.g., KRAS/BRAF-guided therapy) and immunotherapy for MSI-H/dMMR tumours. Selected metastases may be treated surgically or with ablative techniques. Supportive and palliative care address symptoms, pain and quality of life. Lifestyle modification and routine screening lower disease risk and improve outcomes.
