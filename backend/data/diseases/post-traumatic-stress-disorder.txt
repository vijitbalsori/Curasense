Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after exposure to traumatic events such as war, accidents, natural disasters, or sexual violence, affecting around 3.9% of the global population. Although most people recover naturally, about 5.6% of those exposed to trauma develop PTSD, with higher rates following violent conflict and sexual violence. PTSD is characterized by intrusive memories or flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance of trauma reminders, and hyperarousal symptoms such as hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and persistent feelings of danger. These symptoms cause significant impairment in daily, social, and occupational functioning. PTSD may begin immediately or within one month after trauma, and in children may present through reenactment behavior or somatic complaints. Risk factors include previous trauma, female gender, younger age, low education, family history of mental illness, severe or repeated trauma, physical injury during the event, and lack of social support. PTSD commonly co-occurs with depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and increases risk of suicidal behaviors and cardiovascular disease. Up to 40% of affected individuals recover within a year, yet many, especially in low- and middle-income countries, do not access treatment due to stigma, limited services, or lack of awareness. Evidence-based psychological treatments, especially trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), are first-line therapies, often involving controlled exposure to traumatic memories. Self-care practices and rehabilitation strategies can support recovery, and early mental health support after trauma reduces risk of persistent PTSD.
