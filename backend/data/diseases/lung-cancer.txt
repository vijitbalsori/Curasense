Lung cancer arises from uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lung and is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The two major types are non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), which grows more slowly, and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), which is more aggressive. Smoking is the primary risk factor, but non-smokers may be affected due to secondhand smoke, radon, asbestos, air pollution, occupational carcinogens, hereditary syndromes, and chronic lung disease. Symptoms include persistent cough, chest pain, dyspnea, weight loss, and hemoptysis; early symptoms may be mild, leading to delayed diagnosis. Diagnosis involves imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI), bronchoscopy, biopsy with histopathology, and molecular testing to identify biomarkers guiding targeted therapies. Early-stage disease is typically treated with surgical resection, often combined with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation; SBRT is an option when surgery is not feasible. Advanced or metastatic disease relies on systemic treatments such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy for mutation-positive tumors, and immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors; radiation or surgery may be used for symptom control. Low-dose CT screening is recommended for high-risk individuals to detect cancer early and improve survival. Supportive and palliative care address pain, respiratory symptoms, and emotional needs to maintain quality of life. Prevention focuses heavily on smoking cessation, tobacco control policies, and reduction of environmental exposures. Early detection and individualized multidisciplinary care are critical for improving outcomes.
