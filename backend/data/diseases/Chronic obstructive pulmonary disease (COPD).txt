Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disorder characterized by persistent airflow limitation due to airway inflammation, mucus obstruction and destruction of alveoli (emphysema) or chronic bronchitis. Symptoms include chronic cough (often with phlegm), wheezing, exertional breathlessness and fatigue, with acute worsening episodes known as exacerbations. Smoking is the leading cause worldwide, along with air pollution, occupational dusts/chemicals and indoor biomass smoke; genetics and recurrent infections also contribute. Diagnosis is confirmed by spirometry showing airflow obstruction. COPD is not curable but symptoms and progression can be improved by smoking cessation, avoiding pollutants and receiving influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Treatment centers on inhaled bronchodilators (short- and long-acting) with or without inhaled corticosteroids; proper inhaler technique is essential. Severe cases may require oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation and management of exacerbations with antibiotics or systemic steroids when indicated. Complications include pneumonia, heart disease, lung cancer, metabolic disorders, anxiety and depression. Advanced COPD leads to reduced exercise capacity, disability and significant healthcare burden.
