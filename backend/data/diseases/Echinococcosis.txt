Human echinococcosis is a zoonotic parasitic infection caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus, with two clinically important forms: cystic echinococcosis (CE) due to E. granulosus and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) due to E. multilocularis. Humans become accidental intermediate hosts by ingesting eggs shed in the feces of infected dogs or wild carnivores. In CE, larval cysts develop mainly in the liver and lungs, often remaining asymptomatic for years until enlarging to cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chronic cough or dyspnoea. AE behaves like a slow-growing infiltrative hepatic tumour with an incubation period of 5–15 years, leading to weight loss, abdominal pain, hepatic failure and possible metastatic spread. Diagnosis relies on ultrasonography supported by CT or MRI, and serology. CE treatment options include albendazole therapy, PAIR (puncture–aspiration–injection–re-aspiration), surgery or watch-and-wait, chosen according to cyst stage. AE requires early radical surgery combined with long-term albendazole; late-stage disease is often incurable. Both diseases cause substantial morbidity, with over 1 million people affected worldwide and high disability burden. Prevention focuses on breaking the dog–livestock cycle through regular dog deworming, proper disposal of infected offal, vaccination of sheep (EG95), and community education. AE prevention is more complex, requiring control of infection in domestic and wild carnivores. Robust surveillance and One-Health strategies are essential for reducing incidence and guiding national control programmes.
