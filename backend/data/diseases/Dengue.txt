Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Most infections are asymptomatic, but symptomatic dengue typically presents after a 4–10-day incubation with high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting and rash, usually resolving in 1–2 weeks. Severe dengue can occur, especially during secondary infections, and is characterized by plasma leakage, severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding, rapid drop in platelets, shock or organ impairment. These complications usually appear after the fever subsides and require urgent hospital care. Diagnosis relies on NAATs, antigen tests or serology depending on illness stage. There is no antiviral treatment; management includes acetaminophen for pain and fever, avoidance of NSAIDs due to bleeding risk, adequate hydration, and supportive care in severe cases. Hospitalized patients may require fluid resuscitation and monitoring for shock and hemorrhage. Maternal infection may rarely lead to neonatal complications such as preterm birth or low birthweight. Prevention focuses on avoiding mosquito bites and reducing vector breeding sites; mosquitoes bite primarily during daytime. A vaccine (QDenga) is licensed in some settings for ages 6–16 in high-transmission regions, while other vaccines remain under evaluation.
