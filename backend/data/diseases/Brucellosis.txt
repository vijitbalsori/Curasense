Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused mainly by Brucella melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis and B. canis, transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. It typically presents as a systemic febrile illness with fever, malaise, sweats, weakness, weight loss and arthralgia, though symptoms can be variable or mild. The incubation period ranges from 1 week to 2 months. Complications may include osteoarticular disease, hepatitis, neurobrucellosis, epididymo-orchitis and endocarditis. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion in at-risk individuals plus serological testing, culture or PCR. First-line treatment is doxycycline for 45 days combined with streptomycin for 15 days; an alternative regimen pairs doxycycline with rifampicin for 45 days. Gentamicin may substitute for streptomycin. Treatment in pregnancy and in children under 8 requires alternative combinations such as trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole with rifampicin or an aminoglycoside. Relapse can occur without adequate duration or combination therapy. Prevention relies on avoiding unpasteurized dairy, using protective measures during animal handling, and controlling infection in livestock.
