Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and occasionally by contact with contaminated secretions. The diphtheria toxin causes local necrosis and formation of a thick grey pseudomembrane over the tonsils, pharynx or nasal mucosa, leading to airway obstruction, dysphagia and breathing difficulty. Symptoms typically begin 2–5 days after exposure with fever, sore throat, swollen cervical lymph nodes and general weakness. Systemic absorption of toxin can result in myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, peripheral neuropathy and cranial nerve deficits; untreated severe disease carries a case fatality rate up to 30%, especially in young children. Unvaccinated and under-vaccinated individuals are most at risk, and outbreaks commonly occur in settings with low immunization coverage, population displacement or disrupted health services. Diagnosis is clinical and supported by laboratory testing. Immediate treatment with diphtheria antitoxin is essential to neutralize circulating toxin, alongside antibiotics such as erythromycin or penicillin to halt bacterial replication; vaccine should be given after recovery. Close contacts require prophylactic antibiotics and vaccination if not fully immunized. Prevention relies on high-coverage routine vaccination with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines, given in childhood with booster doses in adolescence. Despite a safe and effective vaccine, global resurgences continue where immunization gaps persist.
