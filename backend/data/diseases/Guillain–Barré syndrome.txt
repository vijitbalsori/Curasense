Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute autoimmune neuropathy in which the immune system attacks peripheral nerves, causing progressive weakness, sensory loss, and possible respiratory failure. Symptoms typically begin with tingling and weakness in the legs, ascending to the arms and face, and may progress to paralysis; about one-third develop respiratory muscle involvement requiring intensive care. Swallowing and speech difficulties can occur in severe cases. Most patients recover over weeks to months, though some may have residual weakness. GBS often follows infections, especially Campylobacter jejuni, influenza, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, or Zika virus; post-vaccination cases are extremely rare. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by reduced reflexes, cerebrospinal fluid albuminocytologic dissociation, and EMG findings. Continuous monitoring for respiratory decline is essential. Treatment includes intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange, along with supportive care, prevention of complications, and rehabilitation. Mortality is low but can occur from respiratory failure, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac arrhythmias.
