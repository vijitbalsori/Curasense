Noma (cancrum oris) is a rapidly progressive gangrenous infection of the mouth and face, primarily affecting malnourished children aged 2–6 years and immunocompromised adults. It begins as a gum lesion progressing to acute necrotizing gingivitis, then rapidly destroys soft tissue, muscle, bone and facial skin. The disease is opportunistic and non-contagious, linked to severe malnutrition, immune suppression, poor oral hygiene, concurrent infections and extreme poverty. Clinical diagnosis is based on WHO’s 5-stage classification: gingivitis → necrotizing gingivitis → edema → gangrene → scarring/sequelae. Early detection is critical; early-stage treatment includes antibiotics, improved oral hygiene, antiseptic mouth rinses and nutritional support, often halting progression. Advanced disease results in extensive tissue loss, difficulty eating and speaking, secondary infections, and high mortality; survivors typically require complex reconstructive surgery. Diagnosis relies on clinical signs and identification of causative polymicrobial agents from grains collected via FNA or biopsy; imaging helps assess disease extent. Treatment of fungal or bacterial infections depends on the organism, but therapy is long, costly, and often inaccessible in endemic regions. Prevention focuses on improving nutrition, oral hygiene, and avoiding barefoot walking in endemic areas to reduce trauma. Noma is now classified as a WHO neglected tropical disease, prompting integrated surveillance, early case detection, health worker training and strengthened community awareness.
