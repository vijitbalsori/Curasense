Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with Vibrio cholerae, mainly serogroups O1 and O139. After an incubation of 12 hours to 5 days, infected individuals may develop sudden profuse watery diarrhoea and rapid dehydration; most cases are mild or asymptomatic but can still transmit bacteria for 1–10 days. Severe cases can lead to hypovolemic shock and death within hours if untreated. Diagnosis during outbreaks is supported by rapid diagnostic tests, but confirmation requires stool culture, seroagglutination, or PCR. Immediate treatment with oral rehydration solution (ORS) is essential; severe dehydration requires rapid intravenous fluids plus continued ORS, and antibiotics are recommended for severe disease. Mass antibiotic prophylaxis is not advised due to lack of benefit and risk of antimicrobial resistance. Prevention relies on safe water, sanitation and hygiene practices, particularly safe food handling, handwashing, and proper fecal waste disposal. Oral cholera vaccines (Euvichol-Plus® and Euvichol-S®) provide additional protection, typically using one-dose regimens during shortages. Community engagement is essential to promote early care seeking and safe hygiene practices. With timely and appropriate treatment, case fatality rates should remain below 1%.
