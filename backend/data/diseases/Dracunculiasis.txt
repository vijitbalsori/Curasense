Dracunculiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Dracunculus medinensis, acquired by drinking water containing infected copepods (water fleas). After ingestion, larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate through tissues, maturing over 10–14 months before the gravid female worm (60–100 cm long) emerges through a painful blister, usually on the lower limb. The blister produces intense burning pain, prompting immersion in water, which allows the worm to release thousands of larvae and perpetuate transmission. Disease does not usually cause death, but the prolonged pain, secondary bacterial infections, and weeks-to-months of disability can severely impair mobility and function. Infection occurs mainly in rural areas reliant on stagnant, untreated water sources; some transmission also occurs through eating raw or undercooked aquatic hosts. Diagnosis is clinical, based on the characteristic blister and emerging worm. There is no curative drug or vaccine; treatment consists of slowly extracting the worm over days to weeks and managing secondary infections. Prevention relies entirely on public health measures including safe drinking-water, filtering and treating water, preventing contamination of water sources by infected individuals, and active surveillance with rapid case containment. Animal infections, particularly in dogs and cats, now represent a major barrier to eradication. Despite these challenges, human cases have been reduced to very low numbers, and continued surveillance for at least three years is required before a country can be certified free of transmission.
