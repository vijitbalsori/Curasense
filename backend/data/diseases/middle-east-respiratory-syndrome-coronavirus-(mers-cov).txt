MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease and death. Typical symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with pneumonia common but not universal; gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea may occur. Severe cases can progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. Older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and patients with chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes, renal disease, lung disease, cancer, hypertension) are at higher risk of severe disease. The case fatality rate is approximately 35%, though milder cases may go undetected.
MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, with transmission linked to direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels; camel milk or meat is safe only when pasteurized or properly cooked. Human-to-human transmission occurs mainly through close contact and in health-care settings, causing large hospital outbreaks. No sustained community transmission has been reported. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and laboratory testing. No specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is currently approved; care is supportive, based on clinical severity. Infection prevention and control practices in hospitals are critical to prevent spread, especially before diagnosis. Individuals at high risk of severe disease should avoid contact with camels and raw camel products.
