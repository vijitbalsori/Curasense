Tungiasis is a parasitic skin infestation caused by the female sand flea Tunga penetrans, which burrows into the skin—mainly of the feet—causing intense inflammation, pain, itching and high risk of bacterial superinfection. Transmission occurs when larvae and pupae develop in dry, shaded soil, especially inside homes with unsealed earthen floors, and humans or animals contact contaminated ground. The flea enlarges dramatically as it matures, remaining embedded for 4–6 weeks while releasing eggs back into the environment. Children aged 5–14, older adults, people with disabilities, and those living in extreme poverty are most affected. Diagnosis is clinical, based on the characteristic whitish lesion with a dark central point or evidence of recently extracted fleas. Acute signs include erythema, oedema, desquamation and pain; chronic complications include fissures, ulcers, lymphangitis, nail loss, deformity, and gait impairment. Severe infections may lead to abscesses, septicemia, tetanus or gangrene. NYDA® (dimeticone) is the only highly effective and safe treatment; mechanical extraction should only be performed under sterile conditions by trained personnel. Prevention requires a One Health approach: sealing or insecticide-treating floors, daily foot washing with soap, treating infected animals, and using coconut-oil–based repellents to block flea penetration. Endemic areas include the Caribbean, South America and sub-Saharan Africa, with prevalence reaching 7–63% in affected communities. Long-term control is hindered by poverty, lack of surveillance, limited access to effective treatments and insufficient national investment.
