Tetanus is an acute, often fatal infection caused by Clostridium tetani spores, which are widespread in soil, feces, and contaminated objects and can persist for years due to high resistance. Infection occurs when spores enter the body through wounds, leading to toxin production that causes painful muscle stiffness and spasms; neonatal tetanus arises from contamination of the umbilical stump during unclean deliveries, and maternal tetanus occurs during pregnancy or shortly afterward in inadequately immunized women. The incubation period ranges from 3–21 days, and diagnosis is clinical based on rigid muscles, spasms, or characteristic facial grimacing. Newborns typically present with inability to suck, excessive crying, and generalized spasms. Tetanus is a medical emergency requiring wound care, antitoxin, antibiotics, control of muscle spasms, and supportive management of breathing; survivors do not develop natural immunity and require vaccination. Prevention relies on tetanus-toxoid–containing vaccines, with WHO recommending a 6-dose schedule (3-dose primary series and 3 boosters) starting at 6 weeks of age. Maternal and neonatal tetanus can be prevented through TTCV immunization of women of reproductive age and clean delivery and cord-care practices. Despite major declines in neonatal deaths, tetanus persists where immunization coverage is low, especially in low-income settings. Continued surveillance, strong routine immunization, and school-based boosters are essential to maintain elimination and prevent recurrence.
