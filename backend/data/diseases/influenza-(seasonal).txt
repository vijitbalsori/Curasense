Seasonal influenza is an acute viral respiratory infection caused mainly by influenza A and B viruses, spreading easily through respiratory droplets and contaminated hands. Symptoms typically begin after a 1–4 day incubation period and include sudden fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia and fatigue, while cough may persist for over two weeks. Most cases are mild and self-limiting, resolving within a week with rest and hydration, though severe disease can occur in high-risk groups such as older adults, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic diseases. Complications include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and worsening of underlying conditions. Diagnosis is usually clinical but confirmed by laboratory testing such as RT-PCR or antigen detection when needed. Antiviral treatment is recommended early for high-risk patients or severe illness. Annual vaccination is the most effective prevention strategy, with vaccine formulations updated yearly to match circulating strains; immunity wanes over time, making yearly doses essential. Vaccination reduces severity, complications and mortality, particularly in older adults and vulnerable populations. Transmission can be minimized through respiratory hygiene, handwashing and avoiding contact with infected individuals. WHO monitors global influenza circulation, antiviral resistance and guides vaccine composition and control strategies through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).
