Foodborne botulism is a severe neuroparalytic illness caused by ingestion of pre-formed botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum under anaerobic conditions in improperly processed or stored foods. The organism forms heat-resistant spores that survive in the environment and germinate in low-oxygen, low-acid foods, producing toxin types A, B, E and rarely F that affect humans. Symptoms typically begin 12–36 hours after exposure and include profound fatigue, dizziness, blurred or double vision, drooping eyelids, dry mouth, dysphagia, dysarthria, followed by descending flaccid paralysis that can progress to respiratory failure; fever is absent and consciousness is preserved. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, constipation or abdominal distension may occur. Infant botulism results from intestinal colonization by ingested spores, presenting with constipation, poor feeding, weak cry and hypotonia. Wound botulism develops when spores germinate in contaminated wounds, producing similar neurological symptoms. Diagnosis is clinical and supported by detection of toxin in serum, stool or implicated food, or by isolating the organism. Immediate administration of botulinum antitoxin is critical to halt progression, and many patients require prolonged ventilatory support. Antibiotics are not useful except in wound botulism, where debridement and penicillin are employed. Prevention relies on proper food processing, avoiding feeding honey to infants under 1 year, and controlling conditions that permit spore germination and toxin production.
