Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures caused by abnormal, excessive electrical discharges in the brain. Seizures may be focal or generalized and can manifest as loss of awareness, involuntary movements, sensory disturbances, or prolonged convulsions. Diagnosis requires at least two unprovoked seizures; one isolated seizure does not indicate epilepsy. Causes include structural brain damage, genetic disorders, infections, metabolic abnormalities, immune-mediated conditions, and often remain unknown in about half of cases. People with epilepsy are at increased risk of injuries, psychological comorbidities, and premature mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Up to 70% of patients can achieve seizure control with appropriate antiseizure medications, while discontinuation may be considered after two seizure-free years with careful assessment. About 25% of cases are preventable by addressing risk factors such as perinatal injury, head trauma, infections and stroke. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, EEG, and neuroimaging to identify underlying causes and seizure type. Long-term complications include injuries from falls, drowning, burns, and status epilepticus. Epilepsy imposes significant social and economic burden, with stigma, discrimination, and reduced access to education, employment, and insurance. Early diagnosis, continuous access to medication, and community education improve outcomes and reduce treatment gaps, particularly in resource-limited settings.
