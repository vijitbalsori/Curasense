Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose that, over time, damages blood vessels and organs including the heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves. In 2022, 14% of adults globally were living with diabetes, and more than half were not receiving medication, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Symptoms may appear suddenly in type 1 diabetes, while type 2 diabetes often develops gradually with mild or unnoticed symptoms for years. Persistent hyperglycaemia increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, kidney failure, neuropathy and foot ulcers that can lead to amputation, as well as irreversible vision loss from diabetic retinopathy. Type 1 diabetes results from insulin deficiency and requires lifelong insulin therapy; its cause and prevention remain unknown. Over 95% of cases are type 2 diabetes, caused by insulin resistance and often linked to excess weight, physical inactivity and genetic factors; it is largely preventable through lifestyle modification. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and raises the risk of complications for both mother and child, and increases future risk of type 2 diabetes. Early diagnosis is essential and can be achieved with simple blood glucose testing. Management includes maintaining healthy diet, physical activity, weight control and appropriate medications such as metformin, insulin and other glucose-lowering agents. Many people also require antihypertensive drugs and statins to lower cardiovascular risk. Long-term care may involve treatment of kidney disease, eye disease and neuropathic complications. WHO supports global diabetes prevention and management through the Global Diabetes Compact and related initiatives aimed at strengthening surveillance, treatment access and health system capacity.
