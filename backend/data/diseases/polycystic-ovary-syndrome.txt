Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common chronic hormonal disorder affecting 6–13% of women of reproductive age, often beginning in adolescence, and characterized by irregular periods, ovulatory dysfunction, elevated androgen levels, and polycystic-appearing ovaries. It is a leading cause of infertility due to anovulation and is associated with metabolic risks, particularly in women with a family history or type 2 diabetes. Symptoms vary and may include menstrual irregularity, acne, hirsutism, weight gain, and cystic ovaries, with psychological effects such as anxiety, depression, and body-image issues being common. PCOS increases the likelihood of comorbid conditions including type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and sleep disturbances. Diagnosis requires at least two of the following: irregular ovulation, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, supported by blood tests showing elevated androgens, though findings vary. There is no cure, but lifestyle modification, healthy diet, and exercise help regulate cycles and reduce metabolic risk. Management includes contraceptive pills for cycle regulation, medications for acne and hirsutism, and ovulation-inducing therapies or IVF for infertility when needed. Early evaluation is recommended for women with irregular periods, infertility, or excessive androgenic symptoms. Proper long-term management is essential due to persistent metabolic and reproductive complications.
