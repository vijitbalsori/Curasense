Post COVID-19 condition (PCC), or long COVID, is a prolonged illness that begins within three months of initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and lasts at least two months, affecting daily functioning and quality of life. It can occur after mild or severe COVID-19 and affects an estimated 6% of people infected, with higher risk in women, older adults, smokers, individuals with obesity or chronic diseases, and those hospitalized or repeatedly infected. PCC can involve multiple organs including the heart, lungs, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system, with proposed mechanisms such as viral persistence, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and micro-thrombosis. Over 200 symptoms have been reported; common issues include fatigue, breathlessness, cognitive impairment (“brain fog”), chest pain, palpitations, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Symptom clusters may reflect conditions like post-exertional malaise or ME/CFS and autonomic dysfunction such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Long COVID increases the risk of complications including kidney impairment, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and mental health disorders. Symptoms often improve within 4–9 months, though around 15% may remain symptomatic at 12 months. Treatment is individualized, focusing on symptom management, rehabilitation, management of new medical conditions, energy-conservation strategies, and gradual return to activity while avoiding relapses. Preventive measures including vaccination, masking, hygiene, and ventilation reduce risk, and reinfection continues to pose a risk for developing PCC.
