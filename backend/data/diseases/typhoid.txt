Typhoid fever is a life-threatening systemic infection caused by Salmonella Typhi, transmitted primarily through ingestion of food or water contaminated with human faeces. After entering the body, the bacteria multiply in the intestinal tract and bloodstream, leading to prolonged high fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation or diarrhoea; a rose-spot rash may appear in some patients. Severe disease can cause intestinal perforation, bleeding, shock or death. Humans are the only reservoir, and infected individuals—including asymptomatic carriers—can shed bacteria and spread the infection. The burden is highest in regions lacking safe water, sanitation and hygiene, particularly the WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions, with an estimated 9 million cases and 110 000 deaths annually. Children are at greatest risk. Diagnosis is confirmed by blood testing, and treatment requires antibiotics, although increasing antimicrobial resistance is complicating care and driving the need for more expensive regimens. Preventive measures include access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation, food-handler hygiene and vaccination. WHO-prequalified typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) provide long-lasting protection from 6 months of age in a single dose and are recommended for routine immunization in endemic countries, especially where antibiotic resistance is high. Older oral and injectable vaccines offer shorter protection and are mainly used for travellers. Broad TCV use is expected to reduce disease burden and slow the rise of drug-resistant Salmonella Typhi.
