Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected intercourse and may result from male, female or unexplained factors. Female causes include ovulatory disorders, tubal obstruction, endometriosis, uterine abnormalities and disorders related to hormonal or ovarian dysfunction. Male causes include impaired sperm production, poor sperm motility, blockages of the reproductive tract and hormonal abnormalities. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use, obesity and exposure to environmental toxins can reduce egg or sperm quality. Many causes are preventable through STI prevention, safe obstetric and surgical care and minimizing toxin exposure. Diagnosis involves evaluating ovulation, tubal patency and semen parameters, along with hormonal and imaging tests. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include ovulation induction, surgical correction of reproductive tract abnormalities or medically assisted reproduction such as IVF. A proportion of cases remain unexplained despite investigation. Infertility can lead to significant psychological distress, and access to fertility care varies widely due to cost and limited services. Early evaluation and prevention strategies can improve outcomes and reduce the need for advanced reproductive technologies.
