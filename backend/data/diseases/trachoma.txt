Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, which spreads through direct or indirect contact with eye and nasal discharge of infected individuals—especially young children—and via certain flies. Active trachoma is highly prevalent in preschool children in endemic areas, reaching rates of 60–90%, with repeated infections common due to close household contact. Chronic, repeated infection leads to conjunctival scarring, inward turning of the eyelid (trachomatous trichiasis), and corneal damage that may result in irreversible visual impairment or blindness, typically manifesting in adulthood. Women are disproportionately affected due to increased exposure to infected children. Environmental risk factors include poor facial hygiene, overcrowding, limited water access, and inadequate sanitation. Trachoma remains hyperendemic in rural, impoverished regions of Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and the Americas, causing visual impairment or blindness in about 1.9 million people. Diagnosis is clinical, based on characteristic inflammatory and scarring changes of the eyelid. Prevention and control rely on the WHO SAFE strategy: Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics (azithromycin) for active infection, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvements. Mass drug administration and corrective surgery have significantly reduced disease burden, leading many countries to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem. Continued surveillance, WASH improvements, and community-wide antibiotic coverage are essential to achieve and sustain elimination targets.
