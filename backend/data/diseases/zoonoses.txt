Zoonoses are infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans through direct contact, food, water or environmental exposure, and may be caused by bacterial, viral, parasitic or unconventional agents. They account for a large share of emerging and existing infectious diseases, with examples including Ebola, salmonellosis and COVID-19, while some, like HIV, began as zoonoses before becoming human-adapted. Human–animal interaction in agriculture, wildlife, and domestic settings increases risk, and outbreaks can disrupt food production and trade. Prevention relies on safe animal husbandry practices, food hygiene, clean water, proper waste management, and behavioral measures such as handwashing after animal contact. Antibiotic use in food-producing animals contributes to antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic pathogens, complicating treatment and control. People at elevated risk include agricultural workers, those living near wild habitats, and individuals exposed to markets selling wild animal products. Urbanization and habitat destruction further increase human–wildlife contact. WHO uses a One Health approach, collaborating with FAO and WOAH through systems like GLEWS to strengthen surveillance, early warning, laboratory capacity, risk assessment and cross-sectoral response to zoonotic threats.
