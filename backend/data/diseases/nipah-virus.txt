Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes illnesses ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis. The natural reservoir is fruit bats of the Pteropus genus, and transmission occurs through contact with infected animals (especially pigs), contaminated food such as raw date palm sap, or close contact with infected people. Human-to-human transmission is well documented, particularly among caregivers and in health-care settings. Symptoms begin after an incubation period of 4–14 days (rarely up to 45 days) and include fever, headache, myalgia, sore throat, followed by drowsiness, altered consciousness and acute encephalitis; severe cases develop respiratory distress, seizures, and coma. Case fatality rates range from 40–75%, and about 20% of survivors develop long-term neurological problems. Diagnosis relies on RT-PCR from bodily fluids and ELISA serology. There is no specific antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine; management is supportive and focused on respiratory and neurological stabilization. Prevention includes avoiding contaminated foods, minimizing contact with fruit bats and sick animals, infection control in health-care settings, and One Health surveillance in animals and humans.
