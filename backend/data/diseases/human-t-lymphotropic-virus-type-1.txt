Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that establishes lifelong infection and is transmitted mainly through breastfeeding, sexual contact, needle sharing and transfusion of cellular blood products. Most infected individuals remain asymptomatic, but 5–10% develop disease. HTLV-1 weakens immune function and can cause inflammatory disorders such as uveitis, dermatitis and pneumonitis. It is also associated with severe complications including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-1–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a chronic neurodegenerative condition causing progressive spastic paraparesis, bladder dysfunction and gait abnormalities. Diagnosis relies on a combination of antibody detection tests (ELISA, confirmatory immunoblot or line assay) and PCR for proviral DNA, since free virus is rarely present in blood. There is no curative treatment; management focuses on treating associated conditions with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or chemotherapy. Prevention depends on safe blood transfusion practices, avoiding needle sharing, promoting safer sex, and modifying breastfeeding when possible in high-risk settings. No vaccine currently exists, and public health efforts emphasize surveillance, early diagnosis and risk-reduction strategies.
