Low back pain (LBP) refers to pain between the lower ribs and the buttock and may be acute, sub-acute or chronic. It is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition and the leading global cause of disability, affecting people of all ages, with peak prevalence between 50–55 years. Most LBP is non-specific, meaning no clear structural or pathological cause can be identified, while specific LBP arises from conditions such as fractures, malignancy or referred pain from internal organs. LBP may present as a dull ache, sharp pain or radiating leg pain due to nerve root involvement, sometimes accompanied by numbness or weakness. Acute LBP often resolves spontaneously, but persistent symptoms can progress to chronic pain associated with sleep disturbance, reduced mobility, psychological distress and major functional limitations. Risk factors for non-specific LBP include physical inactivity, obesity, smoking and high physical workload. Clinical assessment requires physical and psychosocial evaluation to guide management. Treatment focuses on rehabilitation, emphasizing movement, education, and a biopsychosocial approach; medications may be used but are not first-line, especially in older adults. Early activity, exercise, proper posture, and maintaining healthy weight help prevent recurrence. Chronic LBP creates substantial economic burden due to reduced productivity and long-term disability. Rehabilitation interventions aim to restore independence and participation in daily activities. WHO supports improved global access to LBP care through rehabilitation packages, healthy ageing initiatives, and guidelines for non-surgical management.
