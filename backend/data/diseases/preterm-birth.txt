Preterm birth refers to babies born alive before 37 completed weeks of gestation and is categorized by degree of prematurity, with extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks) at highest risk. Globally, an estimated 13.4 million babies were born preterm in 2020, and complications of prematurity caused about 900,000 child deaths in 2019, making it the leading cause of death in children under five. Survivors often face long-term disabilities including learning difficulties, visual impairment, and hearing loss. Preterm birth may occur spontaneously or be medically indicated due to complications such as infections, maternal hypertension, diabetes, or multiple pregnancies, though many cases have no identifiable cause. Risk and survival vary dramatically by region: in low-income settings, up to half of babies born at ≤32 weeks die due to limited access to basic supportive care, whereas survival exceeds 90% in high-income countries. Prevention begins with high-quality antenatal care, including healthy nutrition, risk-factor management, early ultrasound dating, and at least eight prenatal contacts. For women in preterm labor or at high risk, key interventions include antenatal corticosteroids to reduce neonatal complications, tocolytics to delay labor, and antibiotics for membrane rupture. Newborn care recommendations emphasize immediate kangaroo mother care, early breastfeeding, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and caffeine therapy for breathing problems. Keeping mothers and infants together and providing family-centered support improves outcomes. Early detection, timely maternal treatments, and evidence-based neonatal care are critical to reducing deaths and long-term complications from prematurity.
