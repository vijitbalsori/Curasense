Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) is a vector-borne parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or T. b. rhodesiense, transmitted to humans through bites of infected tsetse flies in sub-Saharan Africa. T. b. gambiense causes a chronic form with months to years of mild early symptoms, while T. b. rhodesiense causes an acute, rapidly progressing disease. Infection begins with the haemolymphatic (first) stage, presenting with intermittent fever, headaches, lymphadenopathy, pruritus and joint pain. Without treatment, parasites invade the central nervous system, leading to the neurological (second) stage characterized by behavioral changes, confusion, sensory disturbances, poor coordination, and sleep–wake cycle disruption, which gives the disease its name. Untreated HAT is almost always fatal. Diagnosis requires parasitological tests and staging by examination of cerebrospinal fluid to detect CNS involvement. Early detection through active screening of at-risk communities is critical to prevent neurological progression. Treatment depends on parasite species and disease stage, with second-stage therapy requiring drugs that cross the blood–brain barrier. WHO provides all anti-trypanosomal medicines free of charge and recommends follow-up for up to 24 months due to potential relapse. Control relies on early case detection, treatment, vector control, and surveillance; these measures have reduced annual cases to below 1000 since 2018.
