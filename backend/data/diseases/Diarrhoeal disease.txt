Diarrhoeal disease is a major global cause of morbidity and the third leading cause of death in children under five, responsible for more than 443,000 deaths annually. It is defined as three or more loose stools per day and is most often caused by infectious agents—bacterial, viral or parasitic—transmitted through contaminated food, water or poor hygiene. Children who are malnourished, immunocompromised or living with HIV are at highest risk of severe or fatal disease. The greatest danger is dehydration due to rapid loss of water and electrolytes through stool, vomiting and sweating; severe cases can progress to shock and death if untreated. Common pathogens include rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium, with patterns differing by age group and region. Repeated episodes contribute significantly to childhood malnutrition and impaired growth. Treatment relies on prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS) and a 10–14 day course of zinc, with intravenous fluids for severe dehydration and antibiotics only when indicated for specific infections. Prevention focuses on safe drinking water, sanitation improvements, hygienic food handling and handwashing with soap. Vaccination against rotavirus reduces severe diarrhoea in young children. WHO supports countries in surveillance, prevention strategies, access to ORS and zinc, and improving WASH systems to reduce diarrhoeal disease burden.
