Depressive disorder is a common mental illness characterized by persistent depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, and functional impairment lasting at least two weeks. Symptoms include sadness, irritability, low energy, poor concentration, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, and thoughts of death or suicide. Depression arises from a combination of biological, psychological and social factors, and is more common after trauma, chronic stress, loss, or in those with physical illnesses. Women are affected more often than men. Depression can cause marked impairment in personal, social and occupational functioning. It may present as single or recurrent episodes, or follow specific patterns such as perinatal depression or seasonal depression. Diagnosis is clinical, based on symptom duration and functional impact. Psychological treatments (such as cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy and behavioural activation) are first-line for most cases; antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, are used for moderate to severe depression. Antidepressants are not recommended for children and used cautiously in adolescents. Severe cases may require combined therapy and close monitoring for suicide risk. Prevention strategies include strengthening coping skills, reducing stressors, physical activity, and addressing harmful alcohol use. Depression often coexists with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer, worsening outcomes for both conditions.
