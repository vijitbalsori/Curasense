Leprosy (Hansen disease) is a chronic infectious disease caused mainly by Mycobacterium leprae, affecting the skin, peripheral nerves, upper respiratory mucosa and eyes. It remains a neglected tropical disease, with around 200 000 new cases each year, mainly in Brazil, India and Indonesia. Transmission occurs through prolonged close contact with untreated patients via nasal or oral droplets, but it does not spread through casual contact. Clinical diagnosis relies on cardinal signs: loss of sensation in a hypopigmented or reddish skin patch, enlarged peripheral nerves with sensory or motor impairment, or detection of bacilli on slit-skin smear. Cases are classified as paucibacillary (PB) or multibacillary (MB) for treatment purposes. Leprosy is curable with WHO-recommended multi-drug therapy (MDT)—dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine—given for 6 months in PB and 12 months in MB cases. Patients stop transmitting the disease once MDT is started. Early diagnosis and treatment prevent permanent disability, though MDT alone is insufficient to interrupt transmission. WHO recommends contact tracing with single-dose rifampicin post-exposure prophylaxis (SDR-PEP). Stigma and discrimination remain major challenges for affected individuals. Global strategy efforts focus on zero infection, zero disability and zero stigma, alongside strengthened surveillance, prevention, disability management, and human-rights–centered care.
