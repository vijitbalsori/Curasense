Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in energy or nutrient intake and includes undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight/obesity. Undernutrition manifests as wasting (acute weight loss), stunting (chronic growth failure), underweight, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals such as iodine, vitamin A and iron, which impair immune function, growth and cognitive development. Children under 5, pregnant women and adolescents are particularly vulnerable, with undernutrition contributing to nearly half of all deaths in young children. Overweight and obesity result from excess calorie intake and insufficient physical activity, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. Globally, millions of children and adults are affected by both extremes of malnutrition, with many countries experiencing a “double burden” of undernutrition and obesity. Poverty, poor maternal nutrition, inadequate infant feeding practices, recurrent infections and low-quality diets are major drivers. Diagnosis of malnutrition relies on anthropometric indicators such as weight-for-height, height-for-age and BMI, along with clinical and laboratory assessment of micronutrient status. Management focuses on ensuring adequate nutrient intake, treating underlying infections, providing micronutrient supplementation, and using therapeutic foods for severe wasting. Prevention requires improving diets, supporting breastfeeding, ensuring food security, and addressing socioeconomic determinants. Early-life nutrition, especially during the first 1000 days, is critical for lifelong health and development.
