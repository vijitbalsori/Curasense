Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy occurring after 20 weeks’ gestation, defined by blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg with proteinuria ≥0.3 g/24 hours, and it affects 2–8% of pregnancies worldwide. Severe cases may present with headaches, visual disturbances, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and edema. It can progress to eclampsia, characterized by seizures, and together these conditions cause substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, contributing to tens of thousands of maternal and hundreds of thousands of fetal deaths annually. Risk factors include first pregnancy, multiple gestation, obesity, pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, and family history of pre-eclampsia. Complications include eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, organ damage, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and maternal or fetal death. Magnesium sulfate is the primary treatment to prevent seizures and reduces the risk of eclampsia by more than half; additional management involves antihypertensives, corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity, and timely delivery based on severity and gestational age. Prevention focuses on early prenatal care, blood pressure and urine monitoring, and lifestyle modifications, with low-dose aspirin by 20 weeks and calcium supplementation recommended in high-risk settings. Early detection, close monitoring, and appropriate treatment are essential to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality associated with this life-threatening pregnancy complication.
