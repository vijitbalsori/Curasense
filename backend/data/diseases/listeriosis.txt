Listeriosis is a severe foodborne infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogen notable for its ability to survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures. Humans are infected mainly by eating contaminated ready-to-eat foods, and transmission can also occur from pregnant women to the fetus. Foods commonly linked include deli meats, soft cheeses, unpasteurized dairy, smoked fish, prepared salads, and contaminated vegetables. The bacteria are widespread in soil, water and animal intestines, and can multiply during food processing, distribution and storage. Listeriosis occurs in two forms: a mild non-invasive gastroenteritis causing fever, diarrhea and myalgia after ingesting high bacterial loads, and an invasive form affecting high-risk groups such as pregnant women, newborns, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Invasive disease can lead to septicemia, meningitis and has a mortality rate of 20–30%. Pregnant women are at high risk and infection can result in miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal sepsis. Diagnosis is made by isolating the organism from blood, CSF, or placental tissues, with PCR as a supportive method. Early antibiotic therapy improves outcomes, especially in meningitis or pregnancy. Prevention relies on strict food hygiene, controlling contamination throughout the food chain, and implementing HACCP-based systems. Listeria is killed by pasteurization and proper cooking, and high-risk individuals should avoid high-risk foods. Environmental monitoring in food facilities and rapid outbreak tracing using whole-genome sequencing are key to control.
