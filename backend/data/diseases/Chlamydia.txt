Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Many infections are asymptomatic, but when present, symptoms may appear 1–3 weeks after exposure and can include urethral or vaginal discharge, dysuria, pelvic pain, and anorectal pain or discharge in rectal infections; oral infections are usually asymptomatic. Untreated chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis in men. Neonates exposed during birth may develop conjunctivitis or pneumonia. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by invasive strains, can produce genital ulcers, painful lymphadenopathy, and proctocolitis. Diagnosis relies on nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) from urine or swabs from genital, anal or oropharyngeal sites, with self-collected samples being acceptable. Routine screening is recommended for high-risk groups due to frequent asymptomatic infection. Standard treatment is oral doxycycline or azithromycin; newborn conjunctivitis is treated with azithromycin. Reinfection is common if partners are untreated, so partner notification and treatment are essential. Patients should abstain from sex for 7 days after therapy or use condoms consistently. Chlamydia has no vaccine, but prevention relies on correct condom use and antenatal testing to prevent neonatal transmission.
