Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by over 30 bacteria, viruses, and parasites transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and some can also spread from mother to child or through unsafe blood transfusion. The eight major pathogens of global concern include four curable infections—syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis—and four viral infections: HIV, hepatitis B, HSV, and HPV. STIs are highly prevalent, with more than 1 million curable infections acquired daily and 374 million new cases of the four major curable STIs annually. Many STIs are asymptomatic, and when symptoms occur they are often non-specific, making diagnosis difficult without laboratory testing. Serious complications include infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, chronic pain, neonatal infections, cervical cancer from HPV, and increased HIV transmission risk. Effective prevention includes correct and consistent condom use, vaccination against hepatitis B and HPV, and early treatment. Diagnostic access remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries, although rapid tests exist for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B. Antimicrobial resistance, particularly in gonorrhoea, is a growing threat that reduces treatment options. Syndromic management allows same-day care but misses asymptomatic infections, so WHO recommends gradually integrating laboratory testing and implementing screening for high-risk groups. Partner treatment is essential to prevent reinfection and interrupt transmission. WHO’s global strategy emphasizes prevention, improved diagnostics, antimicrobial stewardship, vaccine development, and strengthened national STI control programmes.
