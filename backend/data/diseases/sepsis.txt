Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by the body’s dysregulated immune response to an infection, leading to organ dysfunction, septic shock, and potentially death if not recognized and treated promptly. It can arise from bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections and is more common in vulnerable groups such as the very young, elderly, pregnant individuals, and people with chronic diseases or immunosuppression. Early signs include fever, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, severe pain, and in children poor feeding, vomiting, or reduced urination. Healthcare-associated infections are a major source of sepsis, often involving drug-resistant pathogens that increase mortality risk and complicate treatment. Diagnosis requires rapid clinical assessment and tests to identify infection and organ involvement, with immediate management involving broad-spectrum antimicrobials, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors if needed for low blood pressure. Prevention depends on reducing infections through good hygiene, sanitation, vaccination, infection-prevention practices in healthcare settings, and responsible antibiotic use. Sepsis contributes significantly to maternal, neonatal, and child mortality and worsens outcomes for patients with HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and other severe infections. Survivors may experience long-term complications requiring ongoing care. WHO’s global strategy emphasizes prevention, early recognition, optimal antimicrobial use, and strengthening health systems to reduce the burden of sepsis worldwide.
