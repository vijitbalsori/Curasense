Ebola disease is a severe, often fatal viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Orthoebolaviruses, with Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV) and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) responsible for major outbreaks. Infection typically occurs after contact with infected wildlife (e.g., fruit bats, non-human primates) or through direct human-to-human transmission via blood, body fluids, or contaminated materials. The incubation period ranges from 2–21 days. Symptoms begin abruptly with fever, fatigue, myalgia, headache and sore throat, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rash, and liver and kidney dysfunction; bleeding manifestations may occur in later stages. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation via PCR, antigen detection, or virus isolation under high-containment biosafety conditions. Early intensive supportive care—including fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, treatment of co-infections and organ support—significantly improves survival. For Ebola virus disease (EBOV), recommended therapeutics include monoclonal antibodies mAb114 (ansuvimab) and REGN-EB3 (Inmazeb). No approved treatments or licensed vaccines exist for Sudan or Bundibugyo virus disease. Transmission risk is highest in healthcare settings without strict infection-prevention practices and during unsafe burial rituals. Survivors may experience prolonged viral persistence in immune-privileged sites, creating potential for late relapse or sexual transmission. Prevention relies on surveillance, contact tracing, safe burials, community engagement, vaccination for EBOV, and use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers.
