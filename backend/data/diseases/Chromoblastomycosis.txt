Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal skin infection caused mainly by pigmented fungi such as Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. monophora and Cladophialophora carrionii, entering through minor skin trauma. It presents as slowly enlarging wart-like or plaque-like lesions, often on legs or forearms, sometimes exceeding 10 cm, with central scarring and dark dots representing clusters of fungal cells. Lesions are usually painless early on but can cause swelling, discomfort, secondary bacterial infection and limb deformity in advanced disease. Long-standing untreated lesions carry a risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Diagnosis relies on identification of muriform (sclerotic) bodies in skin scrapings or biopsy; culture or molecular testing is supportive but not required for treatment decisions. The infection remains localized but can occasionally spread via lymphatics and rarely to the CNS. Oral itraconazole or terbinafine are first-line treatments; prolonged therapy (months to over a year) is often required, especially in extensive disease. Other supportive treatments include cryotherapy, local heat therapy, photodynamic therapy and surgery after antifungal therapy. Early detection and treatment offer the best outcomes. The cost and limited availability of antifungals and diagnostic capacity remain major barriers in endemic regions of Central/South America, Africa and parts of Asia and the Pacific.
