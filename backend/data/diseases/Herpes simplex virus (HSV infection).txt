Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes lifelong viral infection characterized by painful blisters or ulcers that recur periodically. There are two main types: HSV-1, which primarily causes oral herpes but can also cause genital infections, and HSV-2, which is the main cause of recurrent genital herpes. Many infections are asymptomatic, but symptomatic episodes involve painful vesicles or ulcers on the mouth, lips, genitals or anus, often preceded by tingling or burning sensations. Initial outbreaks may include fever, body aches and swollen lymph nodes, while recurrent episodes are usually milder and shorter. Diagnosis is clinical but can be confirmed by viral PCR or culture when needed. Antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) shortens symptom duration and reduces recurrence severity; daily suppressive therapy lowers recurrence frequency and transmission risk but does not cure infection. HSV establishes latency in nerve cells and can reactivate due to triggers such as stress, illness, sunlight, trauma or menstruation. Complications include keratitis, encephalitis, disseminated disease in immunocompromised individuals, and neonatal herpes when transmission occurs during childbirth. HSV-2 significantly increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV. Prevention includes avoiding contact during symptomatic episodes, consistent condom use, medical male circumcision, and counseling for pregnant women to reduce neonatal transmission.
