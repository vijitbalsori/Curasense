Campylobacteriosis is an acute gastrointestinal infection caused mainly by Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, transmitted primarily through undercooked poultry, contaminated meat, unpasteurized milk and unsafe water. Infection commonly affects young children in low-income settings and can cause severe diarrhoea and dehydration. Clinical features include watery or bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea and malaise; symptoms typically last about a week. Most cases are self-limiting, requiring only fluid and electrolyte replacement. Antimicrobial therapy (e.g., macrolides) is reserved for severe, invasive or persistent disease, or to eliminate carrier states. Post-infectious complications include Guillain–Barré syndrome, reactive arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnosis is based on stool culture or molecular detection. The bacteria colonize many warm-blooded animals without causing disease, making zoonotic exposure common. Prevention relies on proper cooking of meat, avoiding unpasteurized dairy, safe water supply, good kitchen hygiene and prevention of cross-contamination during food handling.
