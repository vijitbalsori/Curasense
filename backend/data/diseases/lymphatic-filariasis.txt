Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne parasitic infection caused by filarial nematodes (Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori) that damage the lymphatic system. Infection is usually acquired in childhood and remains asymptomatic for years while causing progressive lymphatic and renal injury. Chronic disease develops as lymphoedema, elephantiasis of limbs, and hydrocele, leading to permanent disability, secondary bacterial infections and recurrent acute inflammatory episodes. Transmission occurs when mosquitoes ingest microfilariae from infected humans, which mature into infective larvae and re-enter humans through subsequent bites. Most infected individuals show no external symptoms but continue to sustain transmission and experience hidden lymphatic damage. Diagnosis relies on detection of microfilariae or antigen tests, with chronic manifestations recognized clinically. Prevention focuses on mass drug administration (MDA) with combinations of diethylcarbamazine, ivermectin and albendazole to reduce microfilariae and interrupt transmission, given annually for several years. Morbidity management is essential and includes hygiene-based limb care, management of acute attacks, elevation and exercise, and surgical correction of hydrocele. Vector control with insecticide-treated nets or indoor spraying supports transmission reduction. Chronic cases require lifelong care to prevent progression, disability and secondary infections. Eliminating lymphatic filariasis prevents irreversible disability and reduces the substantial social and economic burden faced by affected individuals.
