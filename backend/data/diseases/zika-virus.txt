Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, with human outbreaks documented worldwide since 2007. Most infections are asymptomatic, but symptomatic cases present after a 3–14-day incubation with mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise and headache lasting 2–7 days. Zika infection during pregnancy can cause congenital Zika syndrome, including microcephaly, limb contractures, hypertonia, ocular defects, hearing loss, fetal loss and preterm birth; 5–15% of infants exposed in utero show complications. Zika can also trigger Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis in adults. Transmission occurs via mosquito bites, maternal–fetal transmission, sexual contact, blood transfusion, laboratory exposure and possibly organ transplantation. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation with RT-PCR or IgM serology, the latter needing distinction from dengue due to cross-reactivity. There is no specific antiviral treatment; care is supportive with rest, hydration and antipyretics, while NSAIDs should be avoided until dengue is ruled out. Prevention focuses on avoiding mosquito bites through repellents (DEET, IR3535, icaridin), protective clothing, window screens and eliminating standing water breeding sites. Sexual transmission prevention includes condom use or abstinence—throughout pregnancy in endemic areas, and for 3 months (men) or 2 months (women) after returning from transmission zones. No vaccine exists yet, though development is ongoing. WHO supports surveillance, vector control and risk communication under the Global Arbovirus Initiative.
