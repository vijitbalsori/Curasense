Cancer is a group of diseases defined by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that can invade nearby tissues and spread to distant organs through metastasis. It develops through the accumulation of genetic mutations that disrupt normal cell-cycle regulation, promote oncogene activation, and disable tumor-suppressor pathways. DNA damage, chronic inflammation, and ineffective repair mechanisms play major roles in malignant transformation. Common risk factors include tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, radiation exposure, environmental carcinogens, and chronic infections such as HPV, HBV, HCV, and H. pylori. Symptoms depend on the organ involved and may include persistent lumps, abnormal bleeding, pain, unexplained weight loss, cough, or prolonged fatigue. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and confirmation by biopsy with histopathological examination. Staging (often using TNM) determines tumor extent and guides therapy. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy, chosen based on cancer type and stage. Early detection significantly improves treatment response and survival. In advanced disease, palliative care is essential for symptom control and quality-of-life support.
