Marburg virus disease is a severe viral haemorrhagic fever caused by Marburg and Ravn viruses, with case fatality rates up to 88%. Infection usually begins after exposure to caves or mines inhabited by Rousettus fruit bats, the natural reservoir. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with blood or body fluids of infected individuals, contaminated materials, or unsafe burial practices; healthcare workers are at high risk without strict infection control. The incubation period ranges from 2–21 days. Illness starts abruptly with high fever, severe headache and malaise, followed by profuse diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and non-itchy rash. By days 5–7, haemorrhagic manifestations such as bleeding from mucosal sites, gastrointestinal bleeding and venepuncture-site bleeding may appear, accompanied by confusion or neurological signs. Death typically occurs 8–9 days after symptom onset due to shock and severe blood loss. Diagnosis requires high-containment laboratory testing using RT-PCR, antigen detection, or serology. Management consists of early aggressive supportive care, including fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction and treatment of complications. No licensed vaccines or antivirals currently exist, though monoclonal antibodies and vaccine candidates are under evaluation. The virus may persist in immune-privileged sites such as testes or eyes; sexual transmission via semen has been documented for weeks after recovery, necessitating testing or prolonged safer-sex practices. Outbreak control relies on surveillance, case isolation, contact tracing, strict infection prevention and control, and safe burials.
