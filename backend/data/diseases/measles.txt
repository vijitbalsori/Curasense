Measles is a highly contagious viral infection transmitted through respiratory droplets and can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours. It primarily affects children and causes fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a characteristic body rash. Symptoms begin 10–14 days after exposure, with complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, encephalitis, and blindness being responsible for most measles-related deaths. Severe disease is more likely in children under five, adults over 30, malnourished individuals (especially with vitamin A deficiency), and those with weakened immune systems including HIV patients. Pregnant women infected with measles risk premature birth and low-birth-weight infants. There is no specific antiviral treatment; management includes hydration, nutrition, antibiotics for secondary infections, and two doses of vitamin A, which reduce complications and mortality. Measles is preventable through vaccination, with two doses required for full immunity. Despite a safe and inexpensive vaccine, measles remains common in regions with low immunization coverage, especially in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Global vaccination efforts have prevented millions of deaths, but COVID-19 disruptions led to immunity gaps and renewed outbreaks.
