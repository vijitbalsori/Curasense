Hearing loss refers to reduced hearing sensitivity below 20 dB in one or both ears; disabling hearing loss is defined as >35 dB in the better ear. Over 430 million people currently require rehabilitation, and this number is projected to exceed 700 million by 2050. Prevalence increases with age, affecting over 25% of people above 60 years. Hearing loss ranges from mild to profound and may affect communication and daily functioning. Hard-of-hearing individuals generally benefit from hearing aids, cochlear implants and assistive devices, while people who are deaf (profound loss) often rely on sign language and may also benefit from implants. Causes include genetic factors, infections (e.g., congenital infections, otitis media), noise exposure, ototoxic medications, birth complications, ageing, and chronic diseases. Unaddressed hearing loss can lead to delays in speech and language, poor school performance, social isolation, depression and reduced employment opportunities. Up to 60% of childhood hearing loss and most adult causes (noise exposure, ototoxicity) are preventable. Prevention includes immunization, good perinatal care, noise protection, safe listening practices and avoiding ototoxic drugs when possible. Early identification requires systematic newborn, school-age and adult screening, supported by tools like mobile audiometry apps. Management includes prompt treatment of ear diseases, provision of hearing aids or cochlear implants, speech and auditory therapy, communication training and family support. WHO promotes integrated people-centred ear and hearing care (IPC-EHC) guided by the World Report on Hearing.
