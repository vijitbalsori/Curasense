Dental caries is the world’s most prevalent noncommunicable disease, affecting an estimated 2 billion people with permanent-tooth decay and 510 million children with decay in deciduous teeth. It results from the bacterial metabolism of dietary free sugars in dental plaque, producing acids that demineralize tooth enamel; persistent high sugar intake, inadequate fluoride exposure, and poor plaque control are the main drivers. Caries can begin with eruption of the first teeth, increases through adulthood, and, when untreated, causes pain, infection, abscesses, tooth loss, impaired nutrition, and reduced quality of life. The burden falls disproportionately on socioeconomically disadvantaged, marginalized, and rural populations, where untreated disease and tooth extraction are common due to limited access to care. Prevention is highly effective and includes reducing free-sugar consumption, twice-daily toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste (1000–1500 ppm), and community-level fluoride exposure. Population-level measures such as sugar-sweetened beverage taxation, marketing restrictions, and improved food labeling reduce risk. Management of early caries can be achieved in primary care with minimally invasive techniques and topical fluoride, reducing the need for costly procedures. Global direct spending on oral diseases exceeds US$ 387 billion annually, with substantial productivity losses. Integration of essential oral health services into universal health coverage is key to reducing untreated caries and its complications.
