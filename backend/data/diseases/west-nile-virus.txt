West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex. First isolated in Uganda in 1937, it has since become globally distributed, notably after its introduction into the United States in 1999, where it caused widespread outbreaks. WNV circulates primarily in a mosquito–bird–mosquito transmission cycle, with Culex species as the main vectors and birds as the reservoir hosts. Humans and horses are incidental “dead-end” hosts. Most human infections (≈80%) are asymptomatic; about 20% develop West Nile fever characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms and rash. Approximately 1 in 150 infections progresses to severe neuroinvasive disease—encephalitis, meningitis or acute flaccid paralysis—especially in adults over 50 and immunocompromised individuals. Diagnosis relies on detection of WNV-specific IgM in serum or CSF, which may persist for more than a year. There is no antiviral treatment or human vaccine; management is supportive, often requiring hospitalization in severe cases. Prevention focuses on mosquito control, environmental management, community education, and personal protective measures. Surveillance of birds and horses provides early warning because animal outbreaks precede human cases. Standard infection-control precautions protect healthcare workers, and laboratory handling of specimens requires appropriate biosafety measures.
