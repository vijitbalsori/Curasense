Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by over 20 Leishmania species and transmitted through bites of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. The main clinical forms are cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis (VL), with VL being the most severe. Cutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin ulcers, while VL presents with prolonged fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly and anemia, and is fatal if untreated. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may appear months to years after VL treatment and serves as a reservoir of infection. Risk is highest in regions with poor housing, overcrowding, environmental degradation, and malnutrition, and outbreaks commonly occur when non-immune populations move into endemic areas. HIV co-infection dramatically increases disease severity, relapse and mortality, and requires specialized treatment regimens. Diagnosis of VL relies on clinical features plus parasitological or serological testing, whereas cutaneous/mucocutaneous forms require parasitological confirmation. Treatment depends on disease type, species and geography; VL requires urgent and complete therapy because medicines suppress but do not eradicate the parasite, making immunosuppressed patients prone to relapse. Prevention focuses on vector control, reducing sandfly exposure, improving housing, environmental sanitation, and surveillance. Climate change, deforestation and urbanization influence sandfly distribution and transmission patterns, increasing disease spread.
