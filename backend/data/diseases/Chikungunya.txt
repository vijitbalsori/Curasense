Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral illness caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. After an incubation of 2–12 days, it presents with abrupt high fever and severe, often debilitating polyarthralgia, frequently accompanied by joint swelling, myalgia, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Symptoms overlap with dengue and Zika, leading to possible misdiagnosis. While most patients recover within days to weeks, joint pain may persist for months or years, and severe complications involving the eyes, heart or nervous system can occur, especially in newborns infected intrapartum or early in life, older adults and those with comorbidities. Diagnosis in the first week relies on RT-PCR, while serology detects IgM/IgG from about day 5 onward. There is no specific antiviral therapy; management includes rest, hydration and antipyretics such as paracetamol (avoiding NSAIDs until dengue is excluded). Two vaccines exist but are not yet in widespread use. Prevention depends on mosquito-bite avoidance and vector control through reducing breeding sites, environmental management, repellents, protective clothing and use of insecticide-treated nets for those sleeping during daytime. Recovered individuals typically develop long-lasting immunity.
