Bone fractures are partial or complete breaks in bone caused by trauma or by bone fragility from conditions such as osteoporosis. Fragility fractures occur from low-energy impacts, typically in older adults, and most commonly involve the hip, spine, wrist, humerus and pelvis. They are associated with major morbidity, loss of function, and increased mortality, especially in older adults. Age, low bone mineral density, poor nutrition, inactivity, smoking, alcohol use, corticosteroid therapy, and vitamin D deficiency are key modifiable risk factors, while age, sex, prior fractures and genetic predisposition are non-modifiable contributors. Osteoporosis significantly increases fracture risk by reducing bone density and microarchitectural strength. Diagnosis and risk prediction rely on clinical factors with or without bone mineral density testing. Management includes timely fracture stabilization (surgical or non-surgical), pain control, and early rehabilitation to restore mobility and prevent complications. Secondary prevention focuses on treating osteoporosis, fall prevention, and reducing refracture risk through medications, exercise, calcium/vitamin D optimization, and lifestyle modification. Comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease and dementia worsen outcomes and require co-management. Preventing fragility fractures relies on early identification of high-risk individuals, optimizing bone health, and implementing fall-prevention strategies.
