Falls are a leading global cause of unintentional injury, responsible for an estimated 684 000 deaths annually, with the highest mortality among adults over 60 and the majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Beyond fatalities, around 37 million falls each year require medical attention, contributing over 38 million DALYs lost, making falls a major cause of long-term disability. Older adults are particularly vulnerable due to age-related declines in balance, vision, cognition, and muscle strength, leading to severe injuries such as hip fractures and traumatic brain injuries. Children also face high risk due to developmental behaviours, inadequate supervision, and hazardous environments. Gender patterns show men experience higher mortality while women suffer more non-fatal fall injuries. Risk factors include chronic illnesses, medications affecting balance, unsafe home environments, and occupational hazards. Falls often lead to long-term functional impairment, institutionalization, and significant healthcare expenditure. Prevention strategies include strength and balance training, home hazard modifications, vision correction, safer housing and community design, and multifactorial risk assessments for older adults. For children, environmental safety, supervision, and protective measures reduce risks. Many fundamental safety interventions—such as installing handrails, adequate lighting, and non-slip surfaces—are widely recommended despite limited formal research because of their obvious benefit. Effective fall prevention reduces morbidity, disability and economic burden across populations.
