Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and from mother to child during birth. Many women are asymptomatic, but symptoms may include vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, or urinary discomfort; untreated infection can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Men typically present with urethral pain, burning during urination, and penile discharge, with possible testicular pain. Rectal infection can cause discharge, pain, or bleeding, while pharyngeal infection is usually asymptomatic. Neonates may develop severe conjunctivitis that can cause blindness if untreated. Diagnosis is best made using molecular tests (NAATs) on urine or swab samples from relevant sites. Gonorrhoea increases susceptibility to HIV. Rising antimicrobial resistance is a major concern, although current treatment relies on cephalosporin antibiotics. Sexual partners need evaluation and treatment, and patients should avoid sex for 7 days after therapy. Consistent condom use is the most effective prevention strategy, as no vaccine is currently available. Early treatment prevents complications and transmission.
