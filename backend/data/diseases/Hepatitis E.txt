Hepatitis E is an acute viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), transmitted primarily through the fecal–oral route, especially via contaminated drinking water. The infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 2–6 weeks, but can occasionally progress to fulminant hepatitis, a life-threatening acute liver failure. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 spread mainly through contaminated water in low-resource settings, while genotypes 3 and 4 cause zoonotic infection through consumption of undercooked meat. Symptoms typically include fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice and dark urine, though many infections in children are mild or asymptomatic. Pregnant women, especially in the second or third trimester, face significantly higher risks of acute liver failure, fetal loss and mortality, with fatality rates reaching 20–25%. Diagnosis relies on detecting anti-HEV IgM antibodies, supported by elevated liver enzymes and, when needed, HEV RNA testing. There is no specific antiviral therapy; management focuses on supportive care and hospitalization for severe cases or symptomatic pregnant women. Prevention depends heavily on water, sanitation and hygiene measures, along with safe food practices. A recombinant hepatitis E vaccine (Hecolin®) is available for adults ≥16 years in China and has been successfully used during outbreaks, including among pregnant women. Public health control requires early outbreak detection, improved WASH infrastructure and targeted vaccination during emergencies.
