Pneumonia is an acute respiratory infection in which alveoli fill with pus and fluid, causing painful breathing and reduced oxygen intake. It is the leading infectious cause of death in children, responsible for about 740,000 deaths in those under 5 in 2019, with highest mortality in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Pneumonia can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and spreads through inhalation of pathogens from the nose or throat, airborne droplets, or via blood, especially around birth. Key symptoms include cough, fever, fast breathing, lower chest wall indrawing, and wheezing (more common in viral cases); severe illness may cause inability to feed, hypothermia, unconsciousness, or convulsions. Risk is increased by malnutrition, lack of exclusive breastfeeding, weakened immunity, HIV infection, measles, indoor air pollution, and crowded living conditions. Diagnosis in children under five often relies on clinical signs such as rapid breathing or chest indrawing. Most cases respond to first-line oral antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin dispersible tablets, with hospitalization reserved for severe pneumonia. Prevention includes immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles, and pertussis, exclusive breastfeeding for six months, adequate nutrition, reduced indoor air pollution, and improved hygiene. HIV-infected children benefit from daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis to lower pneumonia risk. Early diagnosis, proper antibiotic treatment, and comprehensive prevention strategies are crucial for reducing global child mortality from pneumonia.
