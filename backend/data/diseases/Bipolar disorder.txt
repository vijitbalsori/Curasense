Bipolar disorder is a chronic mood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania or hypomania and depression. Manic episodes involve persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood with increased energy, reduced need for sleep, rapid speech, racing thoughts, impulsive or risky behavior and impaired judgment; severe mania may include psychosis. Depressive episodes present with persistent sadness, loss of interest, low energy, sleep or appetite disturbances, impaired concentration, feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thoughts, lasting at least two weeks. Hypomania involves similar but less severe symptoms that do not significantly impair functioning. The condition has a strong genetic component and is influenced by biological, psychological and environmental factors, with stress, trauma and substance use acting as triggers for episodes. Diagnosis is clinical, based on symptom patterns and episode duration. Effective treatment includes mood stabilizers such as lithium or valproate, and antipsychotics for acute mania; antidepressants may be used cautiously in bipolar depression only with mood stabilizers. Long-term maintenance therapy reduces relapse risk. Side effects such as sedation, tremor or metabolic changes require monitoring. Psychotherapy—including cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy and psychoeducation—improves symptom management, medication adherence and relapse prevention. Lifestyle measures like regular sleep, exercise, stress reduction and avoiding alcohol or drugs support stability.
