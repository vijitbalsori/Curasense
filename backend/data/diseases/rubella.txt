Rubella is a highly contagious viral infection transmitted through respiratory droplets and typically causes a mild illness in children and adults with low-grade fever, rash lasting 1–3 days, lymph node swelling behind the ears, mild conjunctivitis, and occasionally arthralgia, particularly in adult women. Symptoms appear 2–3 weeks after exposure, and individuals are most infectious 1–5 days after rash onset. The major public health concern is rubella infection during early pregnancy, which carries up to a 90% risk of fetal infection and can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). CRS causes severe lifelong disabilities including hearing loss, cardiac defects, cataracts, neurological impairment, diabetes, and thyroid disorders, and infants can shed virus for over a year. A single dose of live attenuated rubella vaccine provides more than 95% long-lasting immunity and is usually administered as MMR, MR, or MMRV; adverse reactions are typically mild. Rubella remains globally present, with 17 865 reported cases in 2022, though vaccination has reduced incidence by 97% since 2000. Prevention relies on high vaccination coverage, especially among women of childbearing age, to eliminate CRS risk. WHO recommends all countries integrate rubella vaccine into national measles immunization programs, with global coverage reaching 69% by 2024. Continued efforts through the Measles & Rubella Partnership support immunization, surveillance, and progress toward rubella elimination worldwide.
