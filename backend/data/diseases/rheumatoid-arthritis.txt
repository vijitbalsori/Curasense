Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation of synovial joints, most commonly affecting the small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet, and causing pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced mobility. Without treatment, RA progressively damages cartilage, bone, and surrounding tissues and can involve extra-articular organs including the heart, lungs, and nervous system. Symptoms often include fatigue, malaise, fever, poor sleep, and loss of appetite, and the disease can impair daily activities, work capacity, physical fitness, and sexual function. RA typically begins in adulthood, especially in older adults, and affects women two to three times more often than men. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, exposure to air pollution or silica dust, older age, and genetic susceptibility. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial to reduce inflammation, slow joint destruction, prevent disability, and achieve potential remission. Management includes anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying medications, physical rehabilitation, assistive devices, and lifestyle measures such as exercise, weight control, and healthy nutrition; severe cases may require joint surgery or replacement. RA has no cure, but long-term multidisciplinary care can maintain function and quality of life. Preventive strategies include smoking cessation, healthy weight maintenance, physical activity, and reduction of occupational exposures.
