Hypertension is defined as persistently elevated blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg on measurements taken on two separate days. It often presents without symptoms, though very high levels may cause headaches, visual disturbances, chest pain or shortness of breath. Major modifiable risk factors include high salt intake, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, obesity, tobacco and alcohol use, and air pollution; non-modifiable factors include older age, family history, diabetes and kidney disease. Chronic uncontrolled hypertension damages blood vessels and can lead to myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure and retinopathy. Diagnosis requires blood pressure measurement by a trained professional, though home monitoring can assist follow-up. Management includes lifestyle modifications such as reduced salt intake, weight control, regular activity, limiting alcohol and quitting tobacco. Most patients require medications such as thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium-channel blockers or beta blockers. Target blood pressure is generally <140/90 mmHg and <130/80 mmHg in people with diabetes, kidney disease or cardiovascular disease. Hypertensive emergencies (≥180/120 mmHg with symptoms) require urgent medical care. Long-term control significantly reduces cardiovascular and renal complications.
