Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC), particularly serotype O157:H7, is a pathogenic strain of E. coli that causes acute gastrointestinal illness. Infection occurs mainly through ingestion of contaminated food or water, especially undercooked ground meat, raw milk, fresh produce, and sprouts. After an incubation of 3–8 days, symptoms typically include abdominal cramps and diarrhoea, often progressing to bloody diarrhoea; fever and vomiting may also occur. Most cases resolve within 10 days, but up to 10% can develop haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), a severe complication characterized by acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia, and thrombocytopenia. HUS occurs mainly in young children and the elderly and may cause neurological complications or chronic kidney damage. Diagnosis is based on stool culture, PCR, or detection of Shiga toxin. Antibiotics and antimotility agents are contraindicated because they may increase the risk of HUS; management is supportive, including hydration and monitoring for renal failure. Cattle and other ruminants are the primary reservoirs, with transmission via contaminated food, water, person-to-person spread, and environmental exposure. Prevention relies on strict food hygiene, thorough cooking of meat to ≥70°C, avoiding raw milk, washing produce, preventing cross-contamination, and hand hygiene. Safe agricultural practices and hygienic slaughtering procedures reduce contamination in the food chain.
