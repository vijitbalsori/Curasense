Rabies is a vaccine-preventable zoonotic viral disease that attacks the central nervous system and is almost 100% fatal once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through the saliva of infected mammals—primarily dogs, which cause up to 99% of human cases—via bites, scratches, or contact with mucous membranes. Initial symptoms include fever, pain, and tingling at the exposure site, followed by progressive encephalitis with hydrophobia, aerophobia, and neurological deterioration leading to death. The incubation period ranges from one week to one year, typically 2–3 months. Globally, rabies causes an estimated 59,000 deaths annually, largely in marginalized populations with limited access to vaccines and immunoglobulins. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is advised for high-risk groups such as laboratory workers and animal handlers, while post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)—which includes immediate wound washing, timely vaccination, and rabies immunoglobulin for severe exposures—is essential for preventing disease after contact with a suspected rabid animal. Intradermal vaccine administration is recommended due to lower cost and equal effectiveness. Mass dog vaccination is the most effective method to prevent human rabies and eliminate transmission at its source; culling dogs does not control rabies. Diagnostic confirmation is typically postmortem through detection of viral antigens or nucleic acids. Early risk assessment and proper PEP remain crucial, as there is no cure after symptom onset. The disease is a priority neglected tropical disease, and global strategies aim to end dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030.
