Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent difficulties in social interaction and communication, along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or sensory responses. Signs often appear in early childhood and may include reduced eye contact, delayed language development, atypical play, resistance to change, focused interests and unusual reactions to sound, touch or other sensations. Intellectual abilities vary widely, ranging from significant impairment to above-average intelligence, and many individuals have co-occurring conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, depression or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The causes of ASD involve complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and prenatal or perinatal factors such as advanced parental age, maternal diabetes, prematurity, low birth weight, or exposure to environmental pollutants or certain medications like valproate during pregnancy. Vaccines do not cause autism, a conclusion supported by extensive scientific research. Diagnosis is clinical, based on behavioral assessments and developmental history. Early intervention with evidence-based behavioral and communication therapies can improve social skills, language development and adaptive functioning. Individuals with ASD may also require management of associated medical or psychiatric conditions and support for sensory, behavioral or learning difficulties. Treatment is personalized, lifelong and multidisciplinary, adapting to changing needs over time.
