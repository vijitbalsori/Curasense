Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a human-specific RNA virus of the Pneumoviridae family that infects the respiratory tract and causes illness ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Infants under six months, elderly adults, and people with underlying conditions such as asthma, COPD, or heart disease are at highest risk for severe disease and death. Globally, RSV causes an estimated 3.6 million hospitalizations and about 100,000 deaths annually in children under five, with most deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. RSV spreads through respiratory droplets and direct contact, and nearly all children are infected by age two. Symptoms begin 4–7 days after exposure and include cough, runny nose, fever (sometimes absent), wheezing, rapid breathing, and chest indrawing; severe disease may cause hypoxia, respiratory failure, and long-term respiratory sequelae such as recurrent wheeze or asthma. Older adults may experience worsening of chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. There is no specific antiviral treatment; management is supportive with oxygen therapy, hydration, and secretion clearance. Prevention tools now include maternal RSV vaccination during late pregnancy and long-acting monoclonal antibodies for infants, with additional options for high-risk young children. These interventions protect against severe RSV for the first months of life but remain costly and less accessible in low-resource settings. Understanding RSV seasonality through global surveillance supports targeted prevention, and WHO recommends countries adopt strategies to protect infants based on feasibility, cost, and health system capacity.
