Cervical cancer arises from persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), responsible for about 95% of cases. Progression from HPV infection to cancer typically takes 15–20 years, but this accelerates to 5–10 years in women with weakened immunity, especially HIV, who have a six-fold higher risk. High-risk HPV types (notably 16 and 18) cause cervical intraepithelial lesions that can evolve into invasive cancer if untreated. Key risk factors include immune suppression, multiple births, early pregnancy, smoking, other STIs and long-term hormonal contraception. Early disease is often asymptomatic; later symptoms include abnormal vaginal bleeding, foul discharge, pelvic or back pain, weight loss and leg swelling. Diagnosis involves HPV testing, visual inspection or colposcopy, followed by biopsy and staging. Precancer treatment includes thermal ablation, cryotherapy or excisional procedures (LEEP/LEETZ, cone biopsy). Invasive cancer is treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and palliative care depending on stage. Prevention relies on HPV vaccination (ideally ages 9–14) and regular screening starting at age 30 (age 25 for women with HIV). Early detection and prompt treatment enable high cure rates.
