HIV is a viral infection that targets CD4⁺ T-lymphocytes, progressively weakening the immune system and predisposing individuals to opportunistic infections and certain cancers. It spreads through blood, sexual fluids, and breast milk, and can be transmitted perinatally. Early infection may be asymptomatic or present with a flu-like illness, followed by a prolonged asymptomatic phase with gradual immunosuppression. Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) is defined by CD4 <200 cells/mm³ or WHO stage 3/4 conditions, with all HIV-positive children under 5 considered advanced. Progression without treatment leads to severe opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, pneumocystis pneumonia, and certain malignancies. Diagnosis relies on rapid antibody testing with confirmatory testing; infants <18 months require virological assays. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral replication, reverses immune damage, and prevents transmission when viral load becomes undetectable. Lifelong ART is required. Prevention includes consistent condom use, harm-reduction services, safe blood practices, and PrEP/PEP for high-risk exposures. Pregnant women require immediate ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Early testing, prompt treatment initiation, and management of opportunistic infections are key to reducing morbidity and mortality.
