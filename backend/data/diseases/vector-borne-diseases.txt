Vector-borne diseases are infections caused by parasites, viruses or bacteria transmitted to humans through blood-feeding vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, flies and bugs. After ingesting pathogens from an infected host, vectors can become permanently infectious and transmit disease with each subsequent bite. These diseases cause more than 700 000 deaths annually, including malaria, dengue, yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya, leishmaniasis, human African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, Japanese encephalitis and onchocerciasis. The highest burden occurs in tropical and subtropical regions and among impoverished populations. Transmission patterns are shaped by environmental, demographic and social factors such as climate change, urbanization, global travel and trade. Climate warming expands vector ranges and lengthens transmission seasons. Vector-borne diseases may cause acute severe illness or chronic lifelong morbidity and disability. Control relies on integrated vector management, improved surveillance, strengthened health systems, water and sanitation access, and community behaviour change to reduce exposure. WHO’s Global Vector Control Response 2017–2030 guides countries in strengthening vector control capacity, outbreak response and prevention to meet global health targets.
