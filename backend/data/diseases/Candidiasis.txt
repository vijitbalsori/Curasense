Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused primarily by Candida species, which normally inhabit mucosal surfaces but overgrow when host defenses or microbiome balance is disrupted. Common forms include vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), oral candidiasis (thrush) and invasive candidiasis seen in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients. VVC presents with vulvar itching, soreness, erythema, and thick white discharge; risk factors include antibiotic use, pregnancy, diabetes, hormonal changes and immune suppression. Oral thrush causes white plaques on oral mucosa, soreness, dysphagia and taste disturbances, often triggered by immunosuppression, antibiotics, steroid inhalers or poor denture hygiene. Invasive candidiasis causes bloodstream and deep-organ infections, particularly in those with central lines, recent surgery or critical illness, and requires urgent systemic antifungal therapy. Increasing antifungal resistance, especially in Candida auris, complicates management. Diagnosis is clinical for mucosal disease and culture or molecular testing for invasive infections. Treatment includes topical or oral azoles for mucosal disease and intravenous antifungals for systemic infection. Prevention focuses on good hygiene, careful antibiotic use, glycemic control, proper inhaler technique and infection control in healthcare settings.
