Hepatitis A is an acute viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV), transmitted primarily through the fecal–oral route via contaminated food, water, or close contact, including oral–anal sexual practices. It does not cause chronic liver disease but can produce mild to severe acute hepatitis, and rarely fulminant liver failure. After an incubation period of about 2–4 weeks, symptoms may include fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, and jaundice; symptomatic disease is more common and more severe in adults, while young children often remain asymptomatic. Diagnosis relies on detecting anti-HAV IgM antibodies, with PCR used for early confirmation. Management is supportive, focusing on hydration, nutrition, and avoidance of hepatotoxic medications. Prevention depends on improved sanitation, safe food and water practices, safer sex behaviors, and vaccination with inactivated hepatitis A vaccines. Immunization is highly effective and recommended for unvaccinated individuals at risk, including travelers, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and populations in outbreak settings.
