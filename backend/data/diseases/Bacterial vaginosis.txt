Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal condition caused by an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora, where protective lactobacilli are replaced by overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, Mobiluncus and others. The exact trigger is unclear, but risk factors include douching, intravaginal practices and sexual activity with new or multiple partners. Many women are asymptomatic, but typical symptoms include thin, grey-white vaginal discharge with a strong fishy odor, itching, irritation and burning during urination. BV itself is usually mild, but untreated cases can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Diagnosis is made through clinical assessment and vaginal fluid testing, commonly using wet mount microscopy, Gram stain, pH measurement and the Amsel criteria. In resource-limited settings, a syndromic approach is used for vaginal discharge. BV is treatable and curable, most effectively with metronidazole (oral or gel); other options include clindamycin (oral or topical), tinidazole and secnidazole. Treatment success improves with lifestyle guidance, especially avoiding douching and unnecessary intravaginal products. When managed syndromically, BV is treated alongside candidiasis and trichomoniasis using appropriate antimicrobial regimens.
