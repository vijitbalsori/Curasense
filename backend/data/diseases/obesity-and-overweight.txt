Overweight is defined as excessive fat accumulation, while obesity is a chronic disease where excess body fat impairs health, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, reproductive problems, musculoskeletal issues and reduced quality of life. Diagnosis is based on BMI (weight/height²) and supported by waist circumference, with age- and sex-specific criteria used for children. Obesity prevalence is rising globally, affecting adults, adolescents and even children under five, with rapid increases noted in low- and middle-income countries. The condition results from energy imbalance and is multifactorial, influenced by obesogenic environments, psychosocial factors, genetics, medications, and certain diseases. Structural barriers such as limited access to healthy foods, unsafe physical environments, and inadequate health-system detection contribute to its progression. High BMI is linked to millions of deaths annually from NCDs including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers, respiratory and neurological disorders. Childhood obesity leads to early-onset NCDs, psychosocial problems, and high likelihood of adult obesity. A double burden occurs in many countries where obesity and undernutrition coexist, especially in children exposed to nutrient-poor, energy-dense diets. Obesity and its related diseases are preventable through early life-course interventions, healthy diet, and physical activity, though environmental and societal factors largely shape individual behaviors.
