Dementia is a progressive syndrome caused by diseases that damage brain cells, leading to decline in memory, thinking, behaviour and daily functioning. It mainly affects older adults but is not a normal part of ageing. Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60–70% of cases; other causes include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal degeneration, HIV-related cognitive decline, alcohol-related brain damage, traumatic brain injury and nutritional deficiencies. Early symptoms include forgetfulness, disorientation, mood changes, apathy and behavioural disturbances, which worsen over time. In advanced stages, patients may lose mobility, continence, the ability to communicate and recognition of familiar people. Risk factors include advanced age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, alcohol misuse, depression, low cognitive stimulation, social isolation and air pollution. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by cognitive testing, imaging and lab evaluation to exclude reversible causes. There is no cure, but management includes control of risk factors, cognitive stimulation, exercise, treatment of psychiatric symptoms and caregiver support. Medications such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine may provide modest symptomatic benefit. Behavioural symptoms may require antipsychotics but only when strictly necessary. Early planning for care, safety and decision-making is important as the disease progresses.
