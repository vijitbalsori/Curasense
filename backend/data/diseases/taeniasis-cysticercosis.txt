Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by Taenia species, primarily Taenia solium, acquired through ingestion of raw or undercooked infected pork. Adult tapeworm infection usually causes mild or nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or constipation. Ingestion of T. solium eggs via fecal-oral contamination can lead to cysticercosis, where larvae (cysticerci) develop in human tissues including muscle, skin, eyes, and the central nervous system. When cysticerci lodge in the brain, they cause neurocysticercosis, presenting with seizures, chronic headaches, visual disturbances, hydrocephalus, meningitis, or focal neurological deficits; some individuals remain asymptomatic for years. Tapeworm infection typically persists for 2–3 years if untreated. Diagnosis of taeniasis involves stool examination for Taenia eggs, whereas neurocysticercosis is confirmed primarily by neuroimaging supported by serological tests. Taeniasis is treated with praziquantel or niclosamide, and sometimes albendazole. Neurocysticercosis requires specialized therapy with albendazole and/or praziquantel, often combined with corticosteroids to control inflammation, and antiepileptic drugs for seizure management; surgical intervention may be needed for specific lesions or hydrocephalus.
