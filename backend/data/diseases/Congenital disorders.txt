Congenital disorders are structural or functional abnormalities present at or before birth, arising from genetic causes (chromosomal or single-gene defects), environmental factors (infections, maternal illnesses, teratogenic drugs, radiation), nutritional deficiencies (folate, iodine), or complex multifactorial interactions. Most severe congenital disorders occur in low- and middle-income countries due to limited nutrition, higher infection exposure and reduced access to health care. Risk factors include consanguinity, advanced maternal age and maternal exposures. Common congenital anomalies include heart defects, neural tube defects, cleft lip/palate, club foot and metabolic or endocrine disorders. Prevention involves preconception and antenatal care including screening for genetic risk, maternal infections, nutritional deficiencies and teratogenic exposures, plus folic acid supplementation and rubella immunization. Prenatal screening uses ultrasound, maternal blood tests, and diagnostic procedures such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. Newborn screening detects metabolic, endocrine, hematologic and sensory disorders to enable early treatment. Management may include surgery, medical therapy (e.g., congenital hypothyroidism treatment), and long-term rehabilitation. Early detection, timely referral and specialist care significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. WHO supports surveillance, prevention, folic acid fortification and improved clinical and rehabilitation services globally.
