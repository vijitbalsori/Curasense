Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a highly prevalent sexually transmitted virus that infects the skin and mucous membranes of the genital area, mouth and throat. Most infections are asymptomatic and clear spontaneously within 1–2 years, but persistent infection with high-risk HPV types can cause precancerous cellular changes, most notably in the cervix. These precancers may progress to cervical cancer over 15–20 years if untreated. HPV can also cause genital warts and less common cancers including anal, vulvar, vaginal, oropharyngeal and penile cancers. Risk is higher in people living with HIV, immunocompromised individuals and those with other STIs. Diagnosis of precancerous cervical lesions relies on HPV testing or cytology; there is no direct test for general HPV infection. Prevention is primarily through vaccination, recommended for girls aged 9–14 before sexual activity, and through condom use and smoking cessation. Cervical cancer screening every 5–10 years (or every 3 years for women with HIV) detects lesions that can be treated with ablation or excision. Treatment exists for genital warts, precancers and invasive cancers, with outcomes best when detected early.
