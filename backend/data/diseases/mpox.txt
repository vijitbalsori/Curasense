Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), an Orthopoxvirus with two major clades (I and II). It typically causes a painful rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes, headache, muscle pain and low energy, with symptoms beginning 1–21 days after exposure and lasting 2–4 weeks. The rash progresses from flat lesions to fluid-filled blisters that crust and fall off; lesions may be few or numerous and can appear anywhere including the face, genitals, palms and soles. Transmission occurs mainly through close skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth, or respiratory contact, and also from contaminated objects, needle injuries, or from parent to infant during pregnancy or birth. Severe disease is more likely in children, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immunity, including uncontrolled HIV. Complications include secondary bacterial skin infections, pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, corneal infection, dehydration, and organ involvement. Diagnosis relies on PCR testing of lesion samples; blood tests are not recommended. Management focuses on supportive care, pain control, and prevention of complications; no proven antiviral treatment exists yet. Vaccination can prevent infection and may be used before or shortly after exposure. People with mpox remain contagious until all lesions heal and new skin forms; isolation and lesion coverage reduce spread.
