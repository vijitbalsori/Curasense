Lead is a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the body and affects multiple organ systems, with children being especially vulnerable. Absorbed lead is distributed to the brain, liver, kidneys and bones, where it may remain for decades and can re-enter the bloodstream during pregnancy, exposing the fetus. Young children absorb far more lead than adults and are commonly exposed through contaminated dust, soil, paint, water or household items, especially in environments with industrial emissions, mining or battery recycling. Even low blood lead levels can impair neurological development, causing reduced IQ, attention problems, behavioural disorders, learning difficulties and decreased educational attainment. High-level exposure can result in encephalopathy, convulsions, coma and death, and survivors often have permanent neurological deficits. Lead toxicity also contributes to anaemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immune dysfunction and reproductive toxicity. In adults, chronic exposure increases risks of cardiovascular disease and kidney damage, while exposure during pregnancy can impair fetal growth and increase preterm birth. There is no safe blood lead level, and harmful effects may occur even at concentrations as low as 3.5 µg/dL. Diagnosis is based on blood lead measurement, and management includes identifying and eliminating the source of exposure and, in severe cases, chelation therapy. Prevention is essential and relies on reducing environmental and occupational lead sources, controlling lead paint, improving hygiene practices, ensuring safe water systems and minimizing exposure in children and pregnant women.
