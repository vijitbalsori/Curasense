Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, transmitted mainly through the faeces of infected triatomine bugs, though congenital, transfusion-, transplant- and orally transmitted infections also occur. The disease has an acute phase, often asymptomatic or presenting with nonspecific fever, lymphadenopathy, headache and rarely chagoma or Romaña’s sign. After parasites disseminate, a prolonged chronic phase follows, during which organisms persist in cardiac and gastrointestinal tissues. Decades later, up to one-third of patients develop cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, heart failure or sudden death, and up to 10% develop megacolon or megaesophagus. Diagnosis relies on parasitological or molecular tests in the acute phase and serology in chronic infection. Treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is most effective early and is recommended for acute, congenital, reactivated and early chronic forms; efficacy decreases with duration of infection, and adverse effects are more common in adults. Both drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy and severe hepatic or renal disease, and nifurtimox is avoided in neurological or psychiatric disorders. Chronic disease requires lifelong follow-up and management of cardiac or digestive complications. Prevention depends on vector control, improved housing, blood and organ donor screening, early detection and treatment to prevent congenital transmission. No vaccine is available.
