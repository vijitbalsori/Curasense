Suicide is a major global public health problem, causing approximately 727 000 deaths each year and ranking as the third leading cause of death among those aged 15–29. It occurs across all regions, with nearly 73% of suicides in low- and middle-income countries. Suicide risk is strongly associated with mental disorders such as depression and alcohol use disorder, previous suicide attempts, acute life stressors, chronic pain, and exposure to conflict, violence, or trauma. Vulnerable groups—including migrants, refugees, Indigenous populations, LGBTI persons, and prisoners—face disproportionately high risk. Many suicides occur impulsively during crises, highlighting the need for early recognition and intervention. Effective, evidence-based prevention includes restricting access to lethal means, responsible media reporting, fostering socio-emotional skills in adolescents, and ensuring early identification and management of suicidal behaviour within health systems. Stigma and lack of awareness often prevent individuals from seeking help, while many countries lack a national suicide prevention strategy. Poor-quality data and under-reporting hinder accurate surveillance, emphasizing the need for improved monitoring. A comprehensive multisectoral approach involving health, education, justice, labour, and media sectors is essential to reduce suicide rates. WHO’s LIVE LIFE initiative provides guidance to help countries implement proven preventive strategies.
