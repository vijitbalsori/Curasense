Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute viral zoonosis caused by a Phlebovirus that primarily affects livestock such as sheep, goats, cattle, and camels, with humans infected through contact with infected animal blood, tissues, or via mosquito bites, mainly Aedes and Culex species. The disease is endemic in parts of Africa and the Middle East and often follows heavy rainfall or flooding that boosts mosquito populations. Most human infections are mild, presenting with acute fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, or photophobia, but a small proportion develop severe complications including retinitis, meningoencephalitis, or hemorrhagic fever. Incubation is typically 2–6 days, and differential diagnosis includes malaria, typhoid, yellow fever, and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Diagnosis relies on PCR, antigen detection, or serology, with samples requiring high-containment laboratory handling. There is no specific antiviral treatment; management is supportive with fluid regulation and monitoring for complications. In animals, RVF causes high mortality and abortion storms, serving as an early warning for human cases. Prevention focuses on animal vaccination before outbreaks, vector control, restricted livestock movement, safe animal handling, and personal mosquito-bite protection. Human vaccines exist only experimentally for high-risk groups, and no licensed human vaccine is commercially available. Strengthening surveillance in animals and humans is crucial for outbreak detection, supported by climate-based forecasting systems and coordinated One Health approaches.
