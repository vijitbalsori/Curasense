Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic infection transmitted mainly through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Five Plasmodium species infect humans, with P. falciparum causing most severe and fatal disease, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and P. vivax dominating in many regions outside Africa. Symptoms typically begin 10–15 days after infection and include fever, chills and headache; severe disease presents with confusion, seizures, respiratory distress, anaemia, organ failure and can be rapidly fatal if untreated. Infants, young children, pregnant women, travellers, and people with HIV/AIDS are at greatest risk of severe malaria and death. Diagnosis requires parasite-based tests using microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. Early treatment is essential and typically involves artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), with injectable artesunate used for severe malaria. Preventive measures include vector control with insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for travellers, and preventive chemotherapy strategies such as seasonal malaria chemoprevention and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy. Malaria vaccines (RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M) are now recommended for children in moderate to high transmission areas and significantly reduce severe malaria. Resistance to insecticides and antimalarial drugs, including emerging artemisinin resistance and HRP2/HRP3 test-evading parasites, poses major challenges. Untreated P. falciparum infection can progress to severe disease and death within 24 hours. Strong surveillance, early treatment, integrated vector control and preventive strategies are essential for malaria control and elimination.
