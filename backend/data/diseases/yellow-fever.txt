Yellow fever is a viral, mosquito-borne disease transmitted mainly by Aedes, Haemagogus, and Sabethes species that breed in domestic, forest, and semi-domestic environments. After an incubation period of 3–6 days, patients develop fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and weakness that usually resolve within 3–4 days. About 15% progress to severe disease with recurrent fever, jaundice, bleeding, organ failure, shock, and a fatality rate of up to 50% within 7–10 days. Diagnosis is difficult early due to nonspecific symptoms and similarity to malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, and other hemorrhagic fevers. There is no specific antiviral therapy; management is supportive and may require intensive care for jaundice or organ failure, with antibiotics used for secondary infections. Two antivirals—sofosbuvir and monoclonal antibody TY014—are restricted to research settings. Prevention relies on a single-dose yellow fever vaccine that confers lifelong immunity in over 99% of recipients within 30 days; it is contraindicated for certain groups and requires careful risk–benefit assessment in adults over 60. Under International Health Regulations, some countries require proof of vaccination for travelers. Outbreak control depends on rapid detection, laboratory confirmation, vector surveillance, and emergency vaccination. The Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy, led by WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi, aims to end epidemics by 2026 through strengthened immunization, surveillance, and preparedness.
