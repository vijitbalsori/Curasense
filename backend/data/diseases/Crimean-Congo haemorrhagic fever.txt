Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe viral haemorrhagic disease caused by a Nairovirus transmitted mainly by Hyalomma ticks or by contact with infected animal blood or tissues. Human-to-human transmission occurs through contact with blood or body fluids, especially in healthcare settings. After an incubation of 1–9 days (tick bite) or 5–13 days (blood exposure), symptoms begin suddenly with high fever, myalgia, headache, photophobia, gastrointestinal symptoms and rapid progression to mood changes and hepatomegaly. Haemorrhagic manifestations such as petechiae, ecchymoses and mucosal bleeding often develop, with possible hepatitis, renal failure, liver failure or pulmonary failure. Case fatality ranges from 10–40%, with deaths typically in the second week of illness. Diagnosis relies on RT-PCR or virus isolation early in illness; antibody tests may be negative initially or in fatal cases. Sample handling requires maximum biosafety due to high risk. There is no proven specific antiviral therapy; supportive management with fluids and monitoring is essential. Ribavirin has been used experimentally but lacks clear evidence. Prevention focuses on tick avoidance, protective clothing, acaricide use in livestock, and strict infection control in healthcare settings. No widely available human or animal vaccine exists. WHO supports surveillance, diagnostics and outbreak response.
