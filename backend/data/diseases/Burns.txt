Burns are injuries to skin or deeper tissues caused by thermal heat, radiation, electricity, friction, radioactivity or chemicals. Thermal burns result from exposure to hot liquids, solids, steam or flames and can destroy skin cells and underlying tissue. Burn severity depends on depth (superficial, partial-thickness, full-thickness), total body surface area involved and associated inhalation injury. Clinical features include pain, erythema, blistering or charred, insensate skin depending on burn depth. Major burns can cause fluid loss, shock, infection, metabolic disturbances and multi-organ complications. Diagnosis is clinical, based on burn depth and surface area (e.g., Rule of Nines). Initial management includes stopping the burning process, cooling with clean running water, removing constrictive items, and avoiding ice or home remedies. Hospital care focuses on airway management (especially in inhalation injury), fluid resuscitation, analgesia, wound care, infection prevention and early excision with grafting for deep burns. Electrical and chemical burns require specific decontamination and monitoring for internal injuries. Long-term complications include scarring, contractures, chronic pain and psychological trauma. Prevention relies on safe cooking/heating practices, child supervision, occupational safety and education on burn first aid.
