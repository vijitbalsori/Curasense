Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children and invades the nervous system, causing rapid onset paralysis that can become irreversible in about 1 in 200 infections. It spreads mainly through the fecal–oral route, multiplying in the intestine, and less commonly through contaminated food or water. Early symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, limb pain, and neck stiffness, and 5–10% of paralyzed patients die due to respiratory muscle involvement. There is no cure for polio, and prevention relies entirely on vaccination through oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), both safe and effective when given multiple times. Since 1988, global vaccination efforts have reduced polio cases by over 99%, with endemic transmission now limited to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Unvaccinated individuals of any age remain susceptible, and failure to interrupt transmission in remaining hotspots risks global resurgence. Robust immunization, disease surveillance, and rapid outbreak response are critical components of eradication strategy. Economic modeling shows eradication could save billions of dollars and prevent paralysis in future generations. Sustained vaccination coverage and adherence to international public health recommendations remain essential until global certification is achieved and maintained.
