Hepatitis D is a severe viral liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) for replication and therefore occurs only in people with HBV infection. HDV–HBV co-infection leads to the most aggressive form of chronic viral hepatitis, with rapid progression to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Transmission occurs through exposure to infected blood or body fluids, including sexual contact, unsafe injections, and rarely from mother to child. Simultaneous HBV–HDV infection usually causes acute hepatitis that can include fever, jaundice, dark urine and abdominal pain, but chronic progression is uncommon. In contrast, HDV superinfection in someone with chronic HBV rapidly accelerates liver damage, with 70–90% developing severe chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Diagnosis requires HDV serology and confirmation with HDV RNA testing, though access to molecular testing is limited in many regions. Traditional treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha has low response rates and significant side effects. Newer therapy with bulevirtide, an entry inhibitor approved in Europe, shows improved outcomes and is under further evaluation. Preventing hepatitis D relies entirely on preventing hepatitis B through timely HBV vaccination, birth-dose coverage, blood safety and harm-reduction measures. Antivirals used for HBV do not directly treat HDV, but are used to control the underlying HBV infection.
