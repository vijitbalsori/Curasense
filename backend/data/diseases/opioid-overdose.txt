Opioids are natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic substances that act on opioid receptors in the brain, producing analgesic, sedative, and euphoriant effects; common opioids include heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, methadone, tramadol, and buprenorphine. Medical use includes pain management and maintenance therapy for opioid dependence, but non-medical use can lead to misuse, dependence, and life-threatening respiratory depression. Opioid dependence is characterized by impaired control, strong craving, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and continued use despite harm. Globally, around 60 million people use opioids, with heroin being the most common illicit form, and prescription opioid misuse increasing. Opioid overdose occurs when respiratory centres are suppressed, and it presents with key signs such as unresponsiveness, abnormal breathing, and pinpoint pupils. Roughly 80% of drug-related deaths involve opioids, and highly potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its analogues have driven large spikes in overdose deaths. Risk factors for overdose include high-dose use, polydrug use (especially with sedatives or alcohol), recent loss of tolerance, medical comorbidities, and social vulnerabilities such as low socioeconomic status. Death is preventable through timely basic life support and administration of naloxone, an effective opioid antagonist with no effect in opioid-naïve individuals. Many countries have limited medical access to naloxone, though community distribution and training have proven effective in reducing mortality, especially among people with opioid use disorder and recently released prisoners. Evidence-based treatment for opioid dependence includes opioid agonist therapy (methadone, buprenorphine), psychosocial support, and antagonist therapy (naltrexone). Appropriate regulation of opioids is crucial to ensure medical availability while minimizing misuse, and surveillance of synthetic opioids remains essential due to their growing contribution to overdose deaths.
