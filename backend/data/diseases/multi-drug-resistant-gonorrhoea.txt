Gonorrhoea is an STI caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, presenting commonly with genital, rectal or pharyngeal infection, though many infections—especially pharyngeal—are asymptomatic. Untreated infection can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, epididymitis, neonatal conjunctivitis, and increased HIV transmission. A major concern is escalating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides (azithromycin), sulphonamide–trimethoprim, quinolones, and emerging resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefixime, ceftriaxone). “Super gonorrhoea,” with high-level resistance to ceftriaxone and multiple other classes, has been identified globally. Most treatment failures involve pharyngeal infections due to poor drug penetration and genetic exchange with commensal Neisseria. AMR increases disease burden by prolonging infection and raising complication rates. Diagnosis relies on NAATs and culture (essential for resistance surveillance). Current treatment guidelines depend on cephalosporins, but rising resistance threatens their effectiveness. Prevention includes safer sex practices, screening of high-risk groups, partner notification and treatment, and careful antibiotic stewardship. No licensed gonococcal vaccine exists, but development is a high global priority.
