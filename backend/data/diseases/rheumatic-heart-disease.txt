Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a chronic, preventable cardiac condition caused by permanent damage to heart valves following rheumatic fever, an autoimmune inflammatory reaction to streptococcal throat or skin infections, primarily affecting children and adolescents in low- and middle-income settings. Repeated or untreated Streptococcus pyogenes infections trigger immune-mediated inflammation that scars the heart valves, leading to stenosis or regurgitation. RHD is most common in overcrowded, impoverished communities with limited healthcare access and remains endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and the Pacific. Symptoms of valve damage may include breathlessness, chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, edema, and signs of heart failure. RHD is a major cause of maternal cardiac complications in pregnancy, where increased blood volume stresses damaged valves and may precipitate arrhythmias or heart failure. There is no cure, and severe disease often requires valve repair or replacement, which is often unavailable or unaffordable in low-resource regions; medications may be needed to manage heart failure, arrhythmias, or risk of clotting. Primary prevention relies on prompt treatment of strep throat with antibiotics, while secondary prevention requires long-term benzathine penicillin G injections every 3–4 weeks to prevent recurrent infections and further valve damage. Many patients are diagnosed late due to limited awareness, poor access to care, and shortages of benzathine penicillin. Strengthening primary care, ensuring reliable antibiotic supply, and improving early diagnosis are key strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality from RHD.
