Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide, with an estimated 156 million new cases in 2020 among adults aged 15–49 years. It is a preventable and curable protozoan infection transmitted through unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Women often present with vaginal discharge—sometimes purulent—accompanied by itching, dysuria, dyspareunia, and vaginal erythema, though many remain asymptomatic; in men, infections are usually asymptomatic but may cause urethritis, penile discharge, or dysuria. Diagnosis is based on genital examination and laboratory testing, with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) being the gold standard; in low-resource settings, syndromic management is used. Treatment consists of metronidazole or tinidazole, with alternatives for rare cases of resistance. Partner notification and treatment are essential to prevent reinfection, and consistent condom use provides effective prevention. Trichomoniasis is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight, and increases the risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 1.5 times. Perinatal transmission, though uncommon, can cause neonatal vaginal or respiratory infection. WHO aims for a 50% reduction in new cases by 2030 and supports improved diagnostics, treatment guidelines, partner services, and surveillance, while monitoring emerging antimicrobial resistance.
