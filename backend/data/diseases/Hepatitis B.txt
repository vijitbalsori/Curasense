Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), capable of producing both acute illness and chronic disease that may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Transmission occurs through exposure to infected blood and body fluids, including sexual contact, unsafe injections, contaminated needles, and perinatal transmission from mother to child. Acute infection is often asymptomatic, but some individuals develop fever, fatigue, jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain, and nausea; severe cases can cause acute liver failure. Chronic infection is more likely when acquired in infancy, with up to 95% progressing to chronic disease, compared with less than 5% of adult-acquired infections. Diagnosis requires laboratory testing such as HBsAg, anti-HBc, and HBV DNA assays, supported by liver function assessment and imaging to evaluate fibrosis. There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B, while chronic infection is managed with long-term antiviral therapy such as tenofovir or entecavir to suppress viral replication and prevent complications. Vaccination is the key preventive measure, with a birth-dose vaccine given within 24 hours followed by further doses, providing long-lasting protection. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission involves maternal antiviral therapy in addition to timely newborn vaccination. Regular testing, safe injection practices, safer sex, and blood screening are essential to reduce transmission and disease burden.
