Influenza viruses are classified into types A, B, C and D, with types A and B causing seasonal epidemics in humans, and only type A capable of pandemics. Influenza A viruses circulate widely in animals—especially wild aquatic birds, the natural reservoir—and occasionally infect humans, most often through exposure to infected poultry, pigs or contaminated environments. Human infections with avian subtypes such as A(H5N1), A(H7N9) and A(H5N6) can cause illness ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia and death, with higher case fatality rates than seasonal influenza. Sustained human-to-human transmission has not been observed for current zoonotic strains. Risk factors include direct or indirect contact with infected poultry, handling carcasses, visiting live bird markets, or close proximity to infected pigs. Diagnosis requires laboratory testing and virus characterization in specialized reference laboratories. Management involves clinical assessment, isolation, supportive care and antiviral treatment when indicated. Pandemics arise when a novel influenza A virus acquires efficient human transmission and the population lacks immunity, making surveillance in both humans and animals essential. Prevention strategies include avoiding contact with sick or dead animals, practicing hand and food hygiene, and implementing biosecurity in agricultural settings. WHO monitors zoonotic and pandemic-potential influenza through GISRS, conducts global risk assessments, and coordinates preparedness, surveillance and vaccine-candidate development with international partners.
