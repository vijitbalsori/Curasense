Induced abortion is the intentional termination of an ongoing pregnancy using medical or surgical methods. Medical abortion involves medications such as mifepristone followed by misoprostol, which induce uterine contractions and expulsion of pregnancy tissue; it is effective and safe in early pregnancy and can be self-managed with proper instructions and support. Surgical abortion, typically via vacuum aspiration or dilation and evacuation, is performed by trained providers depending on gestational age. When conducted with recommended methods and appropriate clinical skills, abortion is a safe medical procedure with very low complication rates. Unsafe abortion occurs when untrained individuals use inappropriate techniques or when procedures are performed in environments lacking minimum medical standards. Complications of unsafe abortion may include severe bleeding, infection, uterine or abdominal injury, sepsis, and infertility, and can be life-threatening without prompt treatment. Post-abortion care includes management of complications, assessment for retained products of conception, counselling, and provision of contraception. Early recognition of complications—such as fever, persistent heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, or foul-smelling discharge—is essential for timely intervention. Psychological support may be required for individuals experiencing emotional distress. Safe, high-quality abortion care relies on correct information, access to effective medications or skilled providers, and appropriate follow-up.
