Hepatitis C is a bloodborne viral infection that affects the liver and can present as either acute, short-term illness or progress to chronic disease that may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Transmission occurs primarily through exposure to infected blood, including unsafe medical injections, unscreened transfusions, shared needles among people who inject drugs, and sexual practices involving blood exposure. Acute infection is usually asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur they may include fatigue, fever, abdominal discomfort, nausea, dark urine and jaundice. Around 30% of infected individuals clear the virus spontaneously, while the remaining majority develop chronic infection, often remaining silent for decades until significant liver damage occurs. Diagnosis involves detecting HCV antibodies followed by confirmatory viral RNA testing and assessing liver fibrosis. There is no vaccine, but hepatitis C is curable with short-course oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which achieve viral clearance in most patients within 8–12 weeks. WHO recommends pan-genotypic DAAs for adults and children over 3 years of age, which have minimal side effects and high cure rates. Early detection and treatment prevent complications and reduce transmission. Prevention relies on avoiding exposure to infected blood through safe injection practices, harm-reduction strategies, blood screening and safe medical procedures. Lifestyle measures such as avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight support liver health during and after treatment.
