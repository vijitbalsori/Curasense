Headache disorders are common neurological conditions marked by recurrent head pain and include migraine, tension-type headache (TTH), cluster headache (CH) and medication-overuse headache (MOH). Migraines cause episodic, often severe headaches lasting 4–72 hours, with nausea, vomiting, photophobia or phonophobia, and may be preceded by aura. TTH presents as pressure or tightness around the head, often stress-related, and may be episodic or chronic. CH causes extremely severe, unilateral orbital pain with tearing, nasal congestion and eyelid drooping, occurring in frequent short attacks. MOH occurs from chronic overuse of headache medications and results in persistent, daily headaches.
Headache disorders affect about 40% of the global population, with migraines a leading cause of neurological disability. Symptoms can impair daily functioning, work productivity, and quality of life, and migraines are associated with increased risk of anxiety and depression. Diagnosis requires clinical evaluation, exclusion of secondary causes, and assessment of trigger factors. Treatment includes analgesics, anti-emetics, migraine-specific drugs (e.g., triptans) and preventive therapies, alongside lifestyle measures such as regular sleep, hydration, and trigger avoidance. Early treatment at symptom onset improves outcomes, especially for migraine. Many individuals remain undiagnosed or untreated due to limited awareness and access to appropriate care.
