Spinal cord injury (SCI) results from traumatic events such as falls and road traffic accidents or from non-traumatic causes including tumors, degenerative or vascular disorders, infections, toxins, and congenital conditions. Injury level and severity determine impairment, causing complete or incomplete loss of motor and sensory function, with paraplegia sparing arm function and tetraplegia affecting all limbs. Autonomic dysfunction is common, impacting bowel and bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and sexual function. SCI leads to major disability, limiting walking, hand use, and self-care, and is associated with high risk of secondary conditions such as respiratory complications, pressure ulcers, urinary infections, spasticity, chronic pain, and cardiovascular problems. Mortality is highest in the first year after injury and is strongly influenced by access to timely emergency care, acute management, and rehabilitation. Global prevalence is estimated at about 15.4 million, with males more commonly affected. Preventable causes include road injuries, falls, violence, and sports/workplace trauma, while non-traumatic cases rise with aging and chronic disease. Management requires rapid prehospital care, surgical or medical stabilization, prevention of secondary complications, and long-term rehabilitation with assistive technologies. Lack of appropriate medical care, rehabilitation access, and assistive devices contributes significantly to disability, mortality, and reduced life expectancy in people with SCI.
