Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are chronic conditions arising from genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The major NCDs include cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. They account for most global deaths, with three-quarters occurring in low- and middle-income countries, and many deaths occurring before age 70. Key behavioural risk factors include unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful alcohol consumption; these lead to metabolic changes such as hypertension, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and obesity. Elevated blood pressure is the leading metabolic risk factor for NCD deaths. Environmental risks, especially indoor and outdoor air pollution, significantly contribute to NCD-related mortality. NCDs are closely linked with poverty due to high healthcare costs and limited access to services in disadvantaged populations. Prevention focuses on reducing modifiable risk factors and monitoring metabolic indicators. Management requires early detection, screening, long-term treatment and access to essential medicines within primary healthcare systems. Effective NCD interventions are cost-efficient and critical for achieving global health targets, including reducing premature NCD mortality by one-third by 2030.
