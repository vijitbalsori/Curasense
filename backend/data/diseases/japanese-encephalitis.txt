Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a flavivirus prevalent across much of Asia. Most infections are asymptomatic or mild, but about 1 in 250 leads to severe encephalitis after a 4–14 day incubation period. Severe disease presents with sudden high fever, headache, neck stiffness, altered mental status, seizures, coma, and can progress to spastic paralysis or death, with case fatality rates up to 30%. Among survivors, 20–30% develop permanent neurological or cognitive sequelae. JEV is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, primarily in rural and peri-urban areas with pig farming and rice cultivation; humans are dead-end hosts. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion in encephalitis cases and confirmation by detecting JEV-specific IgM in cerebrospinal fluid or serum, preferably CSF. No antiviral therapy exists; management is supportive and requires urgent care. Long-term rehabilitation is often needed for survivors with neurological disability. Safe and effective vaccines—including inactivated, live attenuated and chimeric types—are the main preventive measure and are recommended for all endemic regions. Vaccination programmes have significantly reduced disease burden, and catch-up campaigns are supported by Gavi in eligible countries. Travelers to endemic areas should avoid mosquito bites and may require vaccination depending on exposure risk.
