HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) occurs when mutations in the virus reduce the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART), leading to persistent viral replication and treatment failure. Rising ART use worldwide has been accompanied by increasing levels of resistance affecting all drug classes, including integrase inhibitors such as dolutegravir (DTG). Resistance can be transmitted at infection or acquired during treatment, especially when viral load suppression is not achieved or maintained. Emerging data show DTG resistance in 3.9–19.6% of patients with viraemia, particularly those with prior treatment exposure. Pretreatment resistance to rilpivirine (RPV) varies widely and may affect the success of long-acting cabotegravir/RPV regimens. Infants exposed to maternal DTG-based ART may rarely develop resistance, making surveillance in treatment-naive infants essential. PrEP-associated seroconversions frequently involve resistance to tenofovir or lamivudine, and rare cases show integrase inhibitor cross-resistance with cabotegravir. Diagnosis relies on viral load monitoring and drug resistance testing where available. Preventing HIVDR requires early detection of treatment failure, adherence support, optimized regimen selection, and national surveillance systems. Maintaining sustained viral suppression is the most effective strategy to limit resistance development.
