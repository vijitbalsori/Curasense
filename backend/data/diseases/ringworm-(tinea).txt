Ringworm (tinea) is a common superficial fungal infection caused by dermatophytes that thrive on keratinized tissues of the skin, hair, and nails, producing pruritic, erythematous, ring-shaped lesions. It affects all age groups and is highly contagious, spreading through direct skin contact, shared personal items, contaminated surfaces, or infected animals. Global fungal skin infections affect over 650 million people, with ringworm accounting for more than half, and prevalence is particularly high among children in resource-poor tropical regions where scalp tinea may exceed 25%. A growing international outbreak of tinea corporis with extensive, treatment-resistant disease poses an emerging public health concern. Risk factors include warm humid environments, close contact living, poor hygiene, sweating, occlusive clothing, and exposure in schools, gyms, or heavy industries. Diagnosis is clinical but may be confirmed by microscopy, fungal culture, or molecular testing from skin scrapings. Treatment typically involves topical antifungals, while oral agents are required for scalp infection, nail involvement, widespread lesions, or drug-resistant cases. Proper hygiene, keeping affected areas dry, avoiding sharing personal items, and treating infected pets help prevent transmission. Untreated or severe cases can lead to secondary bacterial infection, chronicity, or scarring alopecia. WHO recognizes rising antifungal resistance and increasing global burden of skin fungal diseases, including ringworm, as part of its skin NTDs initiative.
