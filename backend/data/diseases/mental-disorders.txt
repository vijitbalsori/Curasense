Mental disorders are clinically significant disturbances in cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour, causing distress or impairment. In 2021, 1.1 billion people worldwide lived with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression the most common. Anxiety disorders involve excessive fear and worry, while depression includes persistent low mood or loss of pleasure for at least two weeks, often with sleep, appetite and energy changes; both conditions increase suicide risk but have effective psychological and medical treatments. Bipolar disorder affects 37 million people and features episodes of depression and mania. PTSD arises after traumatic events and involves intrusive memories, avoidance and a persistent sense of threat. Schizophrenia, affecting 23 million, causes hallucinations, delusions and cognitive impairment, and reduces life expectancy by about nine years. Eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, involve harmful eating behaviours and serious health risks. Conduct disorders in children involve persistent violation of rules and others’ rights. Neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD, intellectual disability and autism, involve early-onset cognitive, behavioural, or social difficulties. Despite effective treatments, most people receive little or inadequate care. Social support, inclusive services and WHO’s Mental Health Action Plan and mhGAP programme aim to improve global access to mental health care.
