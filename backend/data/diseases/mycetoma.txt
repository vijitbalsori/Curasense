Mycetoma is a chronic, progressively destructive infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues caused by fungi (eumycetoma) or bacteria (actinomycetoma), usually entering through minor trauma such as thorn pricks. It commonly affects young adult males in tropical and subtropical regions, especially manual laborers who walk barefoot. The disease presents with a painless subcutaneous mass, multiple draining sinuses, and discharge containing grains that hold the causative organism. Over time, infection spreads to deeper tissues and bone, causing deformity, disability, and sometimes requiring amputation; secondary bacterial infection can lead to severe pain and potentially fatal sepsis. Diagnosis relies on clinical features and identification of grains via microscopy, culture, or PCR (most accurate but expensive). Imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, MRI) helps determine disease extent. Treatment depends on the pathogen: bacterial mycetoma is treated with prolonged antibiotic combinations, while fungal mycetoma requires long-term antifungal therapy plus surgery. Outcomes for fungal mycetoma are often poor, with frequent recurrence. Prevention focuses on reducing exposure, particularly avoiding barefoot walking in endemic areas. Early detection and treatment are critical to reduce morbidity.
