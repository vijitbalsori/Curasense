Foodborne trematodiases are parasitic infections caused by helminths such as Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, Fasciola, and Paragonimus, acquired through ingestion of infected freshwater fish, crustaceans, or contaminated aquatic plants. These parasites require freshwater snails as the first intermediate host, and humans become accidental definitive hosts when consuming raw or undercooked intermediate hosts. Clinical features depend on the species and organ involvement. Clonorchis and Opisthorchis infect the biliary tree, causing right upper-quadrant pain, cholangitis, fibrosis, and with chronic reinfection, cholangiocarcinoma. Fasciola infection presents first with an acute hepatic phase marked by fever, hepatomegaly, eosinophilia, and severe abdominal pain as larvae migrate through the liver, followed by a chronic biliary phase with jaundice, anaemia, gallstones, and cirrhosis. Paragonimus primarily infects the lungs, causing chronic cough with haemoptysis, chest pain, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax; ectopic disease may cause cerebral involvement with seizures, headaches, and neurological deficits. Diagnosis relies on exposure history, eosinophilia, stool or sputum microscopy for eggs, and imaging such as ultrasound, CT or MRI to identify hepatic or pulmonary lesions. Chronic infections lead to significant organ damage and disability. Treatment includes praziquantel for clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis, and triclabendazole for fascioliasis and paragonimiasis. Reinfection is common without addressing unsafe food practices, poor sanitation, and animal reservoirs. Control requires a One Health approach combining chemotherapy, food safety education, improved WASH conditions, and veterinary interventions to interrupt transmission.
