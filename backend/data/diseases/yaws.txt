Yaws is a chronic endemic treponematosis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, closely related to the syphilis-causing treponemes. It primarily affects children under 15 years in poor, warm, humid tropical regions, spreading through direct skin contact with infectious lesions. After an incubation of 9–90 days, yaws begins with a papillomatous lesion rich in bacteria, often on the limbs; this may ulcerate and is highly infectious. Secondary yaws appears weeks to months later with multiple lesions or painful swelling of long bones. Diagnosis relies on clinical features supported by serology (TPPA, RPR) or PCR, although serologic tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis and about 40% of ulcers mimic yaws but are due to H. ducreyi. Effective treatment uses single-dose azithromycin or benzathine penicillin, with follow-up at 4 weeks to assess healing and detect possible macrolide resistance. There is no vaccine; prevention includes hygiene improvement and treating close contacts. Eradication relies on total community treatment (TCT) with oral azithromycin (≥90% coverage), combined with surveillance and repeat rounds of mass drug administration. Resistance to azithromycin is rare but requires monitoring. PCR and LAMP technologies support confirmation and resistance detection, aiding elimination efforts integrated into broader skin NTD programmes.
