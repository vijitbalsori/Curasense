Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, an arenavirus transmitted primarily through exposure to urine or faeces of infected Mastomys rodents, which are common in West Africa. About 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, while around 20% develop severe disease affecting multiple organs including the liver, spleen and kidneys. The incubation period is 2–21 days, with gradual onset of fever, weakness and malaise followed by sore throat, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough and abdominal pain. Severe cases may progress to facial swelling, pulmonary oedema, bleeding, shock, seizures, confusion and coma, with a case fatality rate of about 15% among hospitalized patients. Infection during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, leads to extremely high fetal and maternal mortality. Long-term sequelae are common, particularly sudden permanent hearing loss, along with neurologic and visual complications. Diagnosis requires specialized laboratory testing such as RT-PCR, antigen detection or IgM ELISA, and samples must be handled with maximum biosafety precautions. There is no approved antiviral treatment; supportive care improves survival, and ribavirin has been used but remains of uncertain benefit. No licensed vaccine exists, though candidates are in development. Prevention relies on reducing rodent exposure through improved hygiene, safe food storage and environmental sanitation, and strict infection control in healthcare settings. Health workers face significant risk without appropriate PPE. Travellers from endemic areas presenting with febrile illness should be evaluated for Lassa fever when clinically indicated.
