Cardiovascular diseases comprise disorders of the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease. Heart attacks and strokes typically result from vascular occlusion due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture and thrombosis; strokes may also arise from intracranial hemorrhage. Major modifiable risk factors include unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, harmful alcohol use and air pollution, which contribute to hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and obesity. Symptoms of acute myocardial infarction include chest pain or discomfort, breathlessness, nausea, sweating and radiation of pain; stroke presents with sudden focal neurological deficits such as unilateral weakness, facial droop or speech disturbance. Rheumatic heart disease results from chronic valvular damage following untreated streptococcal pharyngitis and presents with dyspnoea, palpitations and fatigue. Management of CVD focuses on rapid treatment of acute events, long-term control of hypertension, diabetes and lipids, and use of cardioprotective medications such as aspirin, statins, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. Severe disease may require interventions such as angioplasty, bypass surgery or valve repair. Early detection and consistent primary care-based risk management substantially reduce CVD morbidity and mortality.
