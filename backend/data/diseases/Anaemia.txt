Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration is reduced, limiting the blood’s ability to transport oxygen to tissues. It commonly results from iron deficiency but may also arise from deficiencies of folate, vitamin B12, vitamin A, or riboflavin, as well as infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, blood loss, pregnancy-related changes, or inherited red blood cell disorders such as thalassemias and sickle cell disease. Symptoms are often nonspecific and may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, palpitations, pale skin, and reduced exercise tolerance; severe anaemia can cause fainting, chest pain, cognitive impairment, and growth or developmental delays in children. Diagnosis is made by measuring haemoglobin levels and assessing red cell indices, followed by evaluation of the underlying cause. Treatment depends on etiology and may include iron therapy, vitamin supplementation, treatment of infections such as malaria or helminths, management of chronic diseases, and control of heavy menstrual or obstetric blood loss. Dietary improvement with iron-rich foods and enhanced nutrient absorption is beneficial in nutritional anaemia. Individuals with inherited disorders may require specialized care including folate therapy, transfusions, or disease-specific management. Early identification and treatment are essential to prevent complications in children, pregnant women, and other high-risk groups.
