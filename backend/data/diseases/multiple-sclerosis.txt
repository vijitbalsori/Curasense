Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder in which the immune system attacks myelin in the brain and spinal cord, causing demyelination and formation of plaques. Symptoms vary depending on lesion location and may include vision loss, fatigue, limb numbness or weakness, gait imbalance, and coordination problems. Symptoms may relapse and remit, or progressively worsen, and can temporarily worsen with heat or infections. The exact cause is unknown, but genetic susceptibility and environmental factors (low vitamin D, higher latitude) contribute; MS is more common in young adults and females. Diagnosis is clinical and supported by MRI showing demyelinating lesions, with lumbar puncture, evoked potentials, and OCT used as adjunct tests. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the mainstay and aim to reduce relapses and slow progression; early initiation improves long-term outcomes. Corticosteroids are used for acute relapses, while symptomatic treatments target fatigue, spasticity, pain, mood disorders, and bladder/sexual dysfunction. Rehabilitation, including physiotherapy and occupational therapy, improves function and reduces disability. Progressive MS has fewer effective treatment options, particularly in low-resource settings. Supportive care, fatigue management strategies, and psychosocial support are essential for quality of life.
