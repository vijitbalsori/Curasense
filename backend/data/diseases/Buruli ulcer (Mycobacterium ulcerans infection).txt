Buruli ulcer is a chronic necrotizing skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, which produces the toxin mycolactone leading to painless tissue destruction. It typically begins as a painless nodule, plaque or limb oedema and progresses to ulceration within weeks; lesions are most common on the limbs and may extend to bone causing osteomyelitis. Disease severity is categorized by lesion size and extent (Categories I–III). Diagnosis in endemic areas is largely clinical, supported by laboratory confirmation using PCR (IS2404), microscopy, histopathology or culture. Differential diagnoses include tropical ulcers, diabetic or vascular ulcers, cellulitis, cutaneous leishmaniasis and yaws. HIV co-infection can worsen disease progression and outcomes. Standard treatment is an 8-week oral antibiotic regimen, currently rifampicin plus clarithromycin; rifampicin plus moxifloxacin is used in Australia. Adjunctive care includes wound management, debridement, skin grafting and physiotherapy to prevent disability. Early detection and treatment are essential to avoid long-term functional limitations. No proven primary preventive measures exist, and BCG offers only limited protection.
