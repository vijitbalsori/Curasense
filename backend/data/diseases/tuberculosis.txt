Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs but capable of involving the kidneys, brain, spine and other organs. About one quarter of the global population carries latent TB infection, of whom 5–10% will progress to active disease, especially infants, children, and people with weak immune systems. Symptoms may be mild for months and include cough, fever, weight loss and night sweats, although some cases remain asymptomatic yet contagious. Diagnosis relies on WHO-recommended rapid molecular tests for both TB disease and drug-resistant TB; tests such as TST, IGRA or TBST identify latent infection. Standard treatment requires daily antibiotics for 4–6 months, and premature interruption can cause drug resistance. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, requires alternative regimens such as the 6-month all-oral BPaLM/BPaL regimen; extensively drug-resistant TB further limits treatment options. TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, who are 12 times more likely to develop disease, highlighting the need for integrated TB/HIV care. Prevention includes rapid diagnosis, prompt treatment, infection control measures, and BCG vaccination in infants to prevent severe childhood TB. Tobacco use, diabetes, undernutrition, alcohol use and HIV infection markedly increase TB risk. Without proper management, TB remains fatal, but with appropriate therapy most cases are curable.
