Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections affect about 1.5 billion people globally, mainly in areas with poor sanitation where parasite eggs contaminate soil. The major species infecting humans are Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworms, while Strongyloides stercoralis is also widespread but requires different diagnostics and treatment. Transmission occurs when infective eggs or larvae in soil enter the body through ingestion of contaminated food or hands, or through skin penetration in the case of hookworms. Light infections may be asymptomatic, whereas heavier infections cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea, malnutrition, anaemia, impaired growth, weakness, and in severe cases intestinal obstruction. S. stercoralis can multiply inside the host and cause fatal hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals. STH infections worsen nutritional status by reducing appetite, impairing nutrient absorption, and increasing nutrient loss. WHO recommends periodic mass deworming of at-risk groups—including preschool and school-aged children, adolescent girls, and pregnant or lactating women in endemic areas—using albendazole or mebendazole, which effectively reduce worm burden and morbidity. Ivermectin is required for S. stercoralis control and is now available for large-scale use. Deworming is integrated into school health programmes and maternal–child health services to improve coverage. Prevention relies on sanitation, clean water, hygiene practices, and continued mass treatment in endemic communities. Monitoring after 5–6 years of preventive chemotherapy assesses prevalence and infection intensity to guide treatment frequency.
