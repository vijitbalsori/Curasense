COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and spreads mainly through close contact via respiratory particles. Symptoms usually begin 5–6 days after exposure and vary from mild to severe, including fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, and breathlessness. Severe disease can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism, and multiorgan injury. Risk of severe illness is higher in people over 60, the unvaccinated, and those with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer, HIV, pregnancy, and chronic heart or lung disease. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, or inability to stay awake. Children may rarely develop a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome. Some individuals develop long COVID, with prolonged fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive dysfunction. Most people recover without hospitalization; treatment depends on disease severity and risk factors. Severe cases require early medical care, oxygen, and appropriate therapies. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death, though infections can still occur. Vaccination is recommended especially for high-risk groups, with updated booster guidance depending on local epidemiology. WHO continues to coordinate global surveillance, vaccine access, treatment guidance, and pandemic response activities.
