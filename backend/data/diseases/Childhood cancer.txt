Childhood cancers include leukemias, brain tumours, lymphomas and solid tumours such as neuroblastoma and Wilms tumour. Unlike adult cancers, most childhood cancers have no identifiable environmental or lifestyle cause; about 10% are linked to hereditary predisposition. Some chronic infections (HIV, EBV and malaria) increase risk in certain regions. Symptoms vary by cancer type but may include persistent fever, headaches, bone pain, weight loss, abdominal masses, pallor or lymphadenopathy. Early diagnosis is critical and relies on awareness of warning signs, timely clinical evaluation, accurate pathology and staging. Treatment is cancer-specific and may involve chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy, supported by nutrition, infection control and psychosocial care. Cure rates exceed 80% where comprehensive care is accessible, but fall below 30% in many low- and middle-income countries owing to delayed diagnosis, limited diagnostic capacity, treatment abandonment, toxicity and limited access to essential medicines. Survivors require long-term follow-up for recurrence and late effects. Palliative care is essential when cure is not possible, providing pain control—including oral morphine—and symptom relief. Strengthening health systems to ensure early diagnosis, access to therapies and supportive care is the most effective strategy for improving survival globally.
